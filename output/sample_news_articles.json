As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M\/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS\/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing\/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia\/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN\/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995\/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US\/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish\/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher\/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center\/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese\/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\n2\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN\/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

(For example the ancient Greeks believed\nthat Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due\nto the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  \n\nChristianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are \nbecause 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life\na safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is \nfollow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\"\nFor all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"\n\nbut i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its\ninfectious nature.

We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we\ndie.      \n\nReligion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.\nSome people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject\nthemselves with jeezus and live with that high. \n\nIt pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious\nwars, of which Christianity has had no small part.\n\nWhen Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind\nto the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live\nwith this mask of fakeness each day.

I wrote that human brains \"are\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\nconscience is properly formed?\n\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\n\n\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\n\n\nThe Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\n\nYou write:\n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\nfrom `confident'.\n\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\n\n\nDarren F Provine \/ kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\ncertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\nway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\ndifficult to respond to.

For\nexample: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space\nworld didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it\npossible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely\nimpersonal cosmos?

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \"fundamentalist\"?  I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he'll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n\nSo far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's\ntrying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern\n\"for now\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.

It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s\/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?

Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG\/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder\/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code \/ small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+\/-0.25 (instead of +\/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC).

I have sometimes tried to put myself\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\nJesus.\n\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\nDavid Koresh was not.\n\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\n\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\npeople to do bad things. \n\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\n\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the\nbegotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and\nnobody else was.","target":3},{"content":"\n\nThere are a lot of people running around saying \"God told me this\" and \n\"God told me that\" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others\nheard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He\nsaid someone told him, \"The Lord gave me a song.\"  He said that it was\nthe worst song he had ever heard.\n\n\"I know why he gave you that song,\" Murillo said, \"He didn't want it anymore.\"\n\nBut God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the\nidea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit\nin the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first\nto put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one\nwe have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  \n\nMany prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures.\nFor example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an \"M\" who\nprophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy\nhe gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies\nbecause the king complained before he heard the prophecy, \"He never prophesies\nanything good about me.\"  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his \nlifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples.\nBarnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an \napostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of\nAgabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet\nbefore he gave them.  \n\nSo prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it \nScripture.  \n\n\nI don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with \nprophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also \nsimilar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies\nin a seemingly prophetic way, for example, \"And his bishoprick let another\ntake\" concerning Judas office.\n\nA clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about\nwhat will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel\nabout the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural\nprophecy can be used in later prophecy.  \n\nSometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge,\nbut gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom\ncan overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap.  \nInterpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often\nconsidered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a \nbit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to\nlabel a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the \nSpirit, and use them according to His leading.","target":3},{"content":"I am trying to convert an m-motion (IBM) video file format YUV to RGB \ndata...\n\nTHE Y portion is a byte from 0-255\nTHE V is a byte -127-127\nTHe color is U and V\nand the intensity is Y\n\nDOes anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs ?\n\nCan someone tell me where to get info on the U and V of a television signal ?\n\nIF you need more info reply at the e-mail address...\nBasically what I am doing is converting a digital NTSC format to RGB (VGA)\nfor displaying captured video pictures.\n\nThanks.\n","target":0},{"content":"\nA book that I can somewhat recommend is :\n                     \n                     Pratical Image Processing in C\n                     by Craig A.

God may choose one individual over\nanother as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not\npreclude that the development of that individual into what he is in\nthis earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.\n\nI do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view\nof an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that\nbefalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater\nlaw in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the\nultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of\nChrist can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that\nwas completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the\nflesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental\nconcepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized\nand mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus\nChrist to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc.\nTheir teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the\ncontinuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism).\nMore important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body,\nthe ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate\nresurrection and judgement on the Last Day.\n\nThere is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind.\nClearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma\nor that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a\nnew impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not\nrefute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of\ncourse, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only\none of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man\nhimself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his\nparents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at\nall indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of\nChrist's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.\n\nThere is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John\nthe Baptist,\n\n   \"If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.\"\n\nThis also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to\nthe human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did\nnot push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\nBible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and\nthat much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes\nunderstandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I\npointedly used \"repeated earth lives\" to distinguish a little from the\noriental doctrines usually associated with the word \"reincarnation\".\nThe phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too\nthat the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely\nfree from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, the most important expression of it being Lessing's \"The\nEducation of the Human Race\".\n\nTo return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and\nEsau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma.\nAnd both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the\nincarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus\nChrist, in my view.","target":3},{"content":"[about the infield fly rule]\n\tUnless he's Deion Sanders, in which case he just heads back to the\ndugout and waits for his next base-running-blunder opportunity.","target":1},{"content":"Toronto Siggraph \n================\n\nWhat: ``Chance's Art'': 2D Graphics and Animation on the Indigo.\n\nBy:    Ken Evans, Imagicians Artware, Inc. \n\nWhen:  Tuesday 20 April 1993 7:00pm-9:00pm \n\nWhere: The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology\n       University of Toronto\n       39A Queen's Park Crescent\n       Toronto\n\nWho:   Members and non-members alike \n       (non-members encouraged to become members...)\n\nAbstract:\n\nImagicians Artware, Inc. is entering into early beta site testing on Silicon \nGraphics workstations of a new 2D abstract artwork and animation package called \nChance's Art.

What I completly disagree with is seperating that\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\n\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\nefforts that you do not see this.\n\n\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \nhappened in the first place.\n\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that\nhas grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to \nchange the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of\nyour position.","target":2},{"content":"\n\n\nBill says ...\n\n\nI presume the one you refer to is \"Space Sailing\" by Jerome L.

THIS VERSION\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \nto contact me.\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\n\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\n\n********\n\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\n-------------------------------------\n\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \n\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \nof three-dimensional molecules?\n\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \nactually doing it?\n\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \ndo with this package???' , read on.\n\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal\/C library that provides you with simple routines \nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\n\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\nline\/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\nwhat it all means later on). \n\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\n\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \n\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\ngraphics and how to use the package.\n\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\n\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\n","target":0},{"content":"\n\nPardon me for being a little confused, but at the beginning of your second \nparagraph, you say, \"God has one set of rules for all his people,\" yet at the \nend of the same paragraph you declare, \"please do not combine the ceremonial \nand moral laws in one.\"  Not only do I not understand where in the Bible you \nfind the declaration that there are 2 laws (ceremonial and moral), but I am \nalso unclear on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first \nplace.  If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law \nthat is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?\n\nI would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, \nwhere Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying \ndepending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can \nprescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for \nJews and Gentiles?

They don't have a real closer -- although\nMike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off\ngreat last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.\nAtlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is \nunlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to\nsuffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.\n\n\n\n  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the\nclub.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of\nplayers..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.

Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting\n      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to\n      assume Biggio and Finley's job.

Below is a very short\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\n\n================================================================\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\n\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\n   Consider deleting these edges.\n\n1) Now, there are two goals:\n\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \n       using the digitized (x,y)'s).\n\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\n   example:\n\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\n       Reference(x,y). \n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\n\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\n\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\nof the edges.\n\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\nobserved (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and\nyou can't allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\n\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass\/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven.

I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that\ncurses will come on you and others.  Although one definition of 'curse'\nis 'retribution', I only meant 'harm or misfortune' when I used the\nword.  Because God loves us he has told us the best way to live in his\nBible.  God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.\n\nKevin Davis wrote (a while ago):\n\nThe Bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death (which is\nmuch worse than AIDS) -- we have all hurt God with our sin.\n\nPaul Conditt reveals his feelings:\n\nThe first issue you bring up is your anger.  It is \"obvious\"ly wrong to\nbe angry (Gal 5:19-20) for any reason, especially *extremely* angry\nwhich is on par with hatred.  Jesus has every reason to be angry at us\nfor putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was \"forgive\nthem Father, they know not what they do.\"  Knowing how forgiving Jesus\nhas been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of\nlove for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause\nfoolish quarrels and more bad feelings.\n\nIt's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to\naddress it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out\nthere was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with\nAIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would\nframe a response something like this:\n\n\"It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is\nsimply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment\nfor people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his\nchildren equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We\nwill all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the\nopportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with\nall of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our\nsin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life\nfor him.\n Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not\nto short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart\nor a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through\nthe worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men\nthat they may perhaps reach out and find him.\"\n\nThe second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears\nof people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is\nactually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the\nearlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been\nexpressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your\nperceptions, but please try to be open-minded.\n\nYou are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people\nbecause they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and\nI do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the\ncity and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some\nbrothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so\nthat you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.\n\nThe third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual\ncontracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their\nsalvation in that there may be repetence involved.\n\nThe important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's\ncommands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or\nmisfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to\nprevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways,\nis to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or\nhusband.\n\nI hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.\n\nLove,","target":3},{"content":"I used the information provided in the recent resource listings and\ntried to ftp to:\n\nccu1.aukland.ac.nz [130.216.1.5]:  ftp\/mac\/architec - *VISION-3D facet\n\nand received an 'unknown host' message.\n\nmail to Paul D.

After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\nheld by our secular society.

Mitchell\n                          March 23, 1993\n \nINTRODUCTION:\n \nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\npurposes.\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\ninformation\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\na\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\n \nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\nand\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\ninterfacing\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\nthe\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\nfacility\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\nconstruction\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\nby the users themselves.\n \nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\n - art and theater\n - bbs and online network users\n - software and game developers\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\n - children\n - the child in all of us\n \nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\n \nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\nmachine-lets.\n \n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\n \n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\n \nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\ndata link to LTM1.\n \nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\nSSTO\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\nlandscape and land.\n \nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\nworldwide\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\ncommercially\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\nham radio operator and computer hardware\/software developers.\n \nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\n \nPLAN OF ACTION:\n \nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be\nissued\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\nmodels\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\n \nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\nbe\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\ntime\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\nto\ntheir campus.\n \nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\nwill\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1\/6 gravity may be\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\n \nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\nexperimentation\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\nlong\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\n \nCONCLUSION:\n \nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\nreal\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in\nspace.\n \n \nMOONLIGHTERS:\n \n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\n \nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\n \nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Very simple, there are some\n  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects\n  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in\n  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can\n  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.\n  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)\n\nOFF\n---\n  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).\n[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed.

These objects range from human figures to airplanes,\n  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely\n  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.\n\n  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file\n  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the\n  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially\n  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to\/from various\n  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,\n  Rayshade 4.0, or vort.

Seems to\nme that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell!]\n\n\n\nYour using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course,\nin your termonology, God could not \"cease to exist.\"  However, that is not what\ndeath ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see\nthat it signifies \"separation.\"  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is\nthe reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one\nmember of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  \n\nI once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. \nShe was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my\n\"girlfriend\" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were\nseparated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided\nthat she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was\ndeath.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is\nseparation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not\nbecause He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go\nthere.  \n\n\n\nWhen I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in\nthat until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He\nwas trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued\non my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and\nunloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us\ndo as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. \nYou have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to\nyou that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  \n\n\nThis may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct\nknowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable.\n Jesus most certainly felt the \"pinpricks\" of life.  As the Scripture say:\n\nHeb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our\nweaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without\nsin.\n\nThe kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes\nwhen He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine\nto think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  \"The Consciousness of\nChrist.\"  I have talked at length with a great many people about this\ninteresting study, including clh.  \n\nIt is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually\nsuffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we\ndo.  He \"grew in knowledge.\"  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose\nto be taught.  It is my understanding that He was \"led of the Spirit\" to such\nan extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and\nJesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him,\nthe tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. \nThat is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was\nliving sequential history as you or I.  \n\nMaybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion\nand one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than\nnot.\n\n\nI was once a member of that club.  THe \"free thinker\" is a glorious ideal.  By\ncontrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository\nof everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find\nsuch a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist\nwishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. \nBut what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his \"rational\ndoubt\" when in fact he was led to it by his \"faith\".  He must acknowledge that\nwhile it is rational doubt for him as a \"free thinker\" to criticize the\nChristian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize\nhim as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no\nfaith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.\n\nPascal pointed out that \"sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive.\n Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.\"  The fact that skeptics are not\nskeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must\nbelieve in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or\neven most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a\nmeasure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define\nhimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-theist.\n\nSome people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In\nmy campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. \nHowever, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word,\nevery point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication\nspeaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make\nsense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.\n\nThat is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism\nis arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out \"Look, your fly\nis undone!\"  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he\nbelieves without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it\nunderlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he\nknows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. \nThe answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on\npresuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before\nit is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and\ncritical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective\nand neutral.  In other words, another myth.  \n\nPresuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is\nsomething we do not doubt -our own assumptions\/presuppostions.  Even these can\nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are\nour silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for\nabsence.\n\n\nOf course that is hardly an original statement.  Milton coined it but it had\nbeen in use for millenia.  It was even used in the first \"Highlander\" movie. \nBut again, your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of\nGod.  You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic\ntheology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His\nprophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.  If you\nare to reject God's annointed savior, then reject Him from a correct\nunderstanding of Himself.","target":3},{"content":"\nThe problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt\nto market it.

That is, we \nobserve in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced \nby a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be \nits own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.\n\nGod, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject \nto such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.

I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.","target":3},{"content":"I'm looking for shading methods and algorithms.\nPlease let me know if you know where to get source codes for that.\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nThomas\n\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n ","target":0},{"content":"Were they palying football or baseball in Detroit on Saturday?

Our Lutheran parish just\ninstituted the \"Tenebrae\" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for \na paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things\nthat I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those \"facts\" were\nalways there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about\nthe differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over\nbreakfast Easter Sunday.\n\nMy wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music\nand worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee\nbut listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong\nhand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong\nas it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\n \nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service\/Mass which promotes\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\nare not shared by everyone.\n\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want \nthem attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\nis Not there.\n\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.

A convert no less, attracted by the\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\nBible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\nof Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\n\tBut recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\nviews about other human beings. \n\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\nweird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\nwha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church.\nIt's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\nnot being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing,\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\n\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\nthis entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\nChristians are a problem.\n\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\nProtestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at\nrecently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\nProtestant thought.)\n\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\nsane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that\nthey're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.

Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nDarren> to cover them up.\n\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\nin their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach,\n\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for \nyourself whether to believe it or not.\"\n\nDarren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not\nDarren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of\nDarren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many\nDarren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though,\nDarren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nDarren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On\nDarren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nAs long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert\nBecker's paperback, \"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason\nin Lutheran theology,\" published by Northwestern Publishing House.\nThis book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University\nof Chicago.","target":3},{"content":"Hi!

Bussard, Journal of\n\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\n\n\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\n\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\n\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\n\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\n\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth\/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth\/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\nthe faith?\"\n\n---------------------------\n\n[No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\nface after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\ndidn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\nceremonial aspects of it).\n\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\n\nHowever there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\nhave to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and\nhow that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\nPaul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\n\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\nbut in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\nPaul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\n\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\nresponding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\nto give Paul so much trouble.\n\nIt's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\nvalues.","target":3},{"content":"Is the \".3ds\" file format for Autodesk's 3D Animation Studio available?\n\nThanks,\nGary","target":0},{"content":"...\n\nFunny.

And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\nyounger.\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?","target":3},{"content":"[Lots of trippy stuff deleted]\n\nWow...

It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that\none of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of\nthe nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume\nthat the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one-\ndimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds\nblow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\nour boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\n\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\n\n\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\n\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\n\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\n\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism\n\tof the model approach to earth problems is warranted because\n\tmany key parameters have not been included.\n\nThis statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.

Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR\/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue\/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF\/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor\/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows\/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware\n  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and\n  can do image arithmetic, etc.\n    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is\n  available for Suns, IBM RS\/6000, Dec\/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and\n  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000\/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.\n     There is currently a project - \"AIPS++\" - underway to rewrite the\n  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an\n  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for\n  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be\n  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with\n  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and\n  Australia to name a few. \n\nLABOimage\n---------\n  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently\n  runs on Sun 3\/xxx, Sun 4\/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.\n  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.\n  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), \n  medicine, biology, physics.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386\/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome\/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads\/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image\/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - \/ * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - \/ *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1\/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper\/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions\/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

The argument against the Sabbath is\nthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the\nceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based\non Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'\nteachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship\noccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these\npoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more\ntime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are\nright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.\n\nAccepting the principle of \"sola scriptura\" does not commit us to\nobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite\nclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is\non where the Bible would have us place the line.\n\nBy the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters\nthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to\ndetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that\nthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship\nfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or\n(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to\ndecide.","target":3},{"content":"Don't knock Vaughn for being a spring training .400 hitter\nbut a .250 regular season hitter.\nAround 30 games played isn't an indication of how good any\nhitter is, and the quality of pitching is way down.\n\nRyan Robbins\nPenobscot Hall\nUniversity of Maine","target":1},{"content":"\n\n\n\n","target":2},{"content":"I have a problem with intersections between two surfaces.\nDoes anybody have a easy to understand algorithm for that or maybe\neven C source??\n","target":0},{"content":"\nAllen, sometimes I think you're OK.

I would rather have the untried\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\nhimself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\n\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\n.220.

If\nOlerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an\nextra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold\nat third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than\nAlomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a\ndouble.)\n\nAnother reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that\nthe runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No\nteam in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players\nthan others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well\nin the 1950's for all teams.  \n\nBill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.

As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes\/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I\/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n","target":0},{"content":"\nA 3DO marketing rep. recently offered a Phillips marketing rep. a $100\nbet that 3DO would have boxes on the market on schedule.

First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.","target":3},{"content":"This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to\n_Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone\ncomplained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the\ncontrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads\nis extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the\nfamous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion.\nThe letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that\nNefertiti was \"a beautiful black queen.\"  This set off an exchange of\nhotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had\nan article from an Egyptologist titled \"Was Cleopatra Black?\"  (The answer\nto the title is \"no\"-- she was greek.)\n\nI have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I\npersonally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in\nWash. DC), and I found it very jarring.

(Though I was wrong about your use\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\n\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\nCreed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\n\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\nbelow)\n\n\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\n\nand\n\n\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\nthrough the Son\"\n\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\n\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\na more preeminent way.\n\n\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\n\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\n\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\nmention of the Son being necessary.\n\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\nposition, which I enunciated above.\n\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\n\n\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\nfrom it.\"\n\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\n\n\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\nis none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.'\"\n\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\n\n\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\nFather,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will\nreceive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\n\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\nis the Spirit created.\"\n\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\n\n\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\nSon, His Sources.\"\n\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\n\n\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.

From the time he is born, the\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\n     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\n     He is also told that to question this (as\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\n     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\n     matter of course.\n     \nBut it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\n     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath\n     of some sort, and the child must learn to put\n     away his brain when the matter concerns God.\n     All of this has some considerable effect on the\n     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the \n     superstitions he's been taught are nearly\n     impossible to remove.\n     \nAll of this leads me to ask whether the theist can\n     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,\n     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.\n     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that\n     God *does* exist and look at everything from\n     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most\n     theists can somewhat, especially when presented\n     with \"mythical gods\" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,\n     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption\n     of God's existence and question it impartially?\n     \nStephen\n\n    _\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/_\/_\/_\/   _\/       _\/    * Atheist\n   _\/        _\/    _\/   _\/ _\/ _\/ _\/     * Libertarian\n  _\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/_\/_\/_\/   _\/   _\/  _\/      * Pro-individuality\n       _\/  _\/     _\/  _\/       _\/       * Pro-responsibility\n_\/_\/_\/_\/  _\/      _\/ _\/       _\/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n-- ","target":3},{"content":"\nWhat about the ELSA WINNER4000 (S3 928, Bt485, 4MB, EISA), or the\nMetheus Premier-4VL (S3 928, Bt485, 4MB, ISA\/VL) ?\n\n\nAs it just happens, SGCS has a Xserver (X386 1.4) that does\n1024x768x24 on those cards.

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\nthe space station.\n\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\navailable funds.\n\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\nthe NASA budget for the President's new technology\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\n\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\nconsider.\n\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\n\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\nachieving that goal.\n\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"","target":2},{"content":"\nAn interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by  \nevangelist David Wilkerson.

He seems, from what I've\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard.\n   From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, \"Why\nbe dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\ncome back.\" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\ncould think of.\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\nrelationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\nthe first time she's ever hung up on someone.)

Summary: we ask \"Why does the\nuniverse exist\" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\nit can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\nquestion invalid?\n= : I don't believe *any*\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n= \n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten\nbeyond the \"shooting the messenger\" stage).\n\nM. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \"What do I \nas an individual Christian base my faith on?\"  Will it be shaken by the\nproduction of evidence that shatters our \"sacred cows\" or will we seek to\nunderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and\ncontinues to say) in his Word?\n\n\"Why do I ask why?\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).\n\nJason.\n\n\n","target":3},{"content":"Hi Damon,  No matter what system or explanation of creation you wish\nto accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation\nfrom nothing, or creation from something.

At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\n\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\nsolutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B\nin their lineup.

This FAQ is so full of error that I\nmust respond to it.  I hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the\npartisan theology.\n\n\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\n\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\n\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\n\n4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye\nAbraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\nAbraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\n\n\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\n\n\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\n\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\nday of the moral law.\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\nmake false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\n\nDarius\n\n[It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\nthink Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\n\nHowever I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\n\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \n\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius'\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it,\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \n\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\nworship was.","target":3},{"content":"Howdy all,\n\n\tI was wondering if people could e-mail me their opinions on\nthe various graphics viewers available for MS-Windows 3.x...

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.

I've\nrefrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with\nthe OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say\nsomething.\n\nMany things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest\nsuggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the\nGospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death\nof Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break\ndown these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there\nis neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If\nMoslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill\nthem.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions.\nThere are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under\nattack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are\nliving together peacefully.\n\nThe precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two\ndifferent things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into\nCanaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have\npromised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be\na holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those\nattacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be\ndefeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in\nJoshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was\npossible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once\nthat was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were\nexpected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of\nagreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted\nBosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior\nwould have disqualified this from being a holy war.\n\nThe other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by\nAssyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel\nfor her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a\njudgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay\nof the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because\nillness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God\nfor good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't\njustify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that\nin attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as\n*unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's\npeople, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were\nactually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action.\nFurthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are\njudgements from God.

Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\" \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\ndarkness.\"  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \n\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite\/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite\/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men.\"\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever\nwont's.\"  ","target":3},{"content":"","target":1},{"content":"of  \nWhy  \n\n","target":1},{"content":"I sent off for my copy today...

It appears that in\na neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two\nhome runs).  Or do they?  What is \"equivalent average?\"\n\nOne thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took\naway some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, \nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \n\n\nFelix Jose has been a .350\/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.\nI would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330\/.530 player.\nMaybe .330\/.550 .  Not even close.\n\n\nI'd put him about there too.  \n\nNote: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't\nwinning.\n\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\nmistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\n\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\n\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\na player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\nand so on.\n\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\n\nWhat hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\n\nIt hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.\n(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\nTuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in\nAtlanta than Greenville.  \n\nThen again, it might not.

This\ndoesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\n\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\nand isn't.  \n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\nforgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\nis an attractive option.\n  I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.","target":3},{"content":"\nUh, I don't think you can call a team with Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman,\nand Nolan Ryan on the pitching staff a team that has \"no talent.\" They\ndid come out of nowhere, but some of the improvement was\nforseeable.

(19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.","target":3},{"content":"\nwondering\n                                                      -------------\n\nDo you mean Juan Berenguer?

Sometimes,\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\nthe pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \n\n\n\n\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \n\n\n\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\nwould win.\n \nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\ngoes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\n\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \npitcher?  They were probably about the same.","target":1},{"content":"Hello,\n\n    I have been searching for a quality image enhancement and\n    manipulation package for Unix\/X\/Motif platforms that is comparable\n    to Adobe Photo Shop for the Mac.\n\n    I have not been able to find any, and would appreciate any\n    information about such products you could provide.\n\n    I would be particularly interested in software that runs on HP or\n    Sun workstations, and does not require special add-in hardware, but\n    would also be interested in other solutions.\n\n\nThank You.\nWayne","target":0},{"content":"","target":1},{"content":"Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at\nleast 10 at-bats.\n\nIt is early in the season so there are some high numbers.

NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's\nreputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the\nAL's highest ERA among starters.

He showed a lot of concentration at\nthe plate in his rookie year.\n\n4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that\nWalk desrved his contract.\n\n5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I\ncan't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through\nwaivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.\nNot a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him\nway too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught\nshould have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed\npitching).

Other\nthan the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,\nPatterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have\npitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money\non Patterson in stead.\n\n8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.\n\n9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.\n10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his\nvalue has increased immensely.\n\n11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.\nLet's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.\nNow why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better\nthan a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.\n\n12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement\nin favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that\nidiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.\n13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good.

Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have\na respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit\nleft handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options\nfor the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was\ngetting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.\n\n14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.\nthey will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.\nNow, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,\nnothing else will.\n\nOn a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2\nstarts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of\nthe season.

The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n==================","target":3},{"content":"Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history\nif we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a\ndefinitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.\nTicket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost\ngone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's\ncould sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for\nmost of the year like '89). \n\tOn another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be\nforced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an\nowner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.\n\tFernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching\nstaff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.\n\tBaltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.\n__________________________________________________________________________\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n Second to last day of the season - Gregg (The True Wild Thing) Olson\nuncorks a wild pitch allowing the Blue Jays to tie.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\n\n  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is \nitself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around\nby the sun's ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as \"earth's\" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       \/     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ \/                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon's image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine's receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where \ndid the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it \nis programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then \ndie)\n\n  Warning about writing to the past:\nI had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel \nfuture, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. \nThere were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an \nOscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, \nand then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\n\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll \nplay a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll \nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go \nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \nyour destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality \nin which you don't want to be a part of.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked\nquestions that you would like included in this posting, send email to\nleech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).\n\n    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to\nyour KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader\nthat can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).\n\n    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down\nby rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in\nthe Ames SPACE archive in FAQ\/faq<#>.\n\n    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The\npoint of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old\nanswers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing\nthan rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided\nbecause they give more complete information than any short generalization.\n\n    Questions fall into three basic types:\n\n    1) Where do I find some information about space?\n\n    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask\n    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There\n    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended\n    discussion.\n\n    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?\n\n    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been\n    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for\n    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.\n\n    3) Miscellanous queries.\n\n    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of\n    FAQ postings.\n\n\n    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE\n\n    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.\n    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]\n    Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.\n    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth\n\t100 posts).\n    Internet mail readers: send requests to add\/drop to SPACE-REQUEST\n\tnot SPACE.\n    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all\n\treferences.)\n    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're\n\tresponding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!\n    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail\n\tor article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the\n\t'reply' function of mailers will work.\n    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone\n\twill get on TV anyway.\n    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:\n\tkeep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals\n\t(use carriage returns).\n\n\n    INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS\n\n    I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas.

He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  \nmany times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  \nwhile knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  \nslugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  \ndave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  \none of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  \nthe scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  \nStadium.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make\nsense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the\ncross, would want to share in his death.","target":3},{"content":"How much better to get wisdom than gold, to choose understanding rather\nthan silver!

You're missing a central teaching of Christianity -\nman is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing\nthat, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\n\n\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?  Do you think Hannibal\ncrossed the Alps?  How do you know?  How do you know for sure?  What\nhistorical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis-\ncredit it as well as the Bible has?\n\n\nWell, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God's\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\nsome people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you've never read \"A Pilgrim's\nProgress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\n\n\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\npopulation.\n\nWell, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\narticle.  I just happened across yours and felt moved to reply.

I got it from\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\neditor.\n\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\n\n    The Patron of Youth\n\n\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\n    the manner expected.\n\n    Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\n    more than his father.\n\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\n\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\n\n    He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to\tshow  his  reciprocal\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\n\n\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\tIgna-\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\n\n\n\t\t\t\t  -12-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\n\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\n\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\n\n    The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\t\"Then\n    leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!\"\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\tpray:\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\n    this  time\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\n    a Jesuit.\n\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\n    the dying for a holy death.\n\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\tcarrying  and\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\tto  the  Lord\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\n\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\n\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\n\n    - Brendan Arthur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\n\nGod Bless\n\nFrom Simon\nLines:  106","target":3},{"content":"\n\nWhich distance?

He wrote it around\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\n\nJoe Buehler\n\n...\n\nSchism and Disobedience\n\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\n\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\nhis attitude clear in the July\/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\nheresy.\"\n\n...\n\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\n\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\nresponse.\n\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\nagainst the unity of the Church.\n\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\n\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\n\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\nparallel Church.\n\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\n\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\n\n....\n\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\n\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime.

Thanks to Andy Odell\nof Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my\nattention.\n\nTHERMAL OBSERVATIONS?\n\n\n  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July\n  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,\n  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,\n  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3\n  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with\n  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something\n  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.\n\n  Jay\n\nand again:\n\n  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet\n  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would\n  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and\n  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a\n  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't\n  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are\n  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One\n  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.\n\njay","target":2},{"content":"\nI have no doubt that God hears everybody's prayers.\nHowever, He does things His way, i.e. things will happen\nonly if it is His will.\n\nNow if the question really is \"Does God grant everybody's wishes ?\"\nthen you'll get a brutal shot of reality similar to when you didn't\nget that toy you wanted for Christmas.

This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.","target":3},{"content":"I'm not sure if you got the information you were looking for, so I'll\npost it anyway for the general public.

Background imagery\/textures\/datafiles\n=========================================\n\n First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP\nlist above.\n\n24-bit scanning:\n----------------\n  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for\n  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :\n  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll\n  house supplies.\n  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have\n  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.\n\nBooks with textures:\n--------------------\n  Find some houses\/books\/magazines that carry photographic material.\n  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also\n  a wide variety of stock art is available.\n  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,\n  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.\n\n  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books\n  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your\n  graphics work. Their address is:\n\tEdition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,\n\t00196 Rome Italy,\n\tPiazzale Flaminio, 19\n\tTel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60\n\nTexture Libraries:\n------------------\na. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit\n   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit\n   TIFF format.

Introduction to rendering algorithms\n========================================\n\na. Ray-Tracing:\n---------------\n\n  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read\n  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would\n  suggest:\n   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press\n     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4\n  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong\n  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines\n  (erich@eye.com)\n\nThere's a more concise reference also:\n\n  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: \"An Introduction to Ray Tracing\", in\n  \"Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD\", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,\n  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.\n\nIt contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.\n\nb. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)\n--------------------------\n\nA good reference is:\n\n        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,\n        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.\n\nc.

Where can I find the geometric data for the:\n================================================\n\na. Teapot ?\n-----------\n\n\"Displays on Display\" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole\nstory about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has\nthe bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe\nmodel of the teapot.\n\nIEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column \"Jim Blinn's Corner\" describes\nan another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for\nexample are used.\n\nThe OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get\nthem to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\n\nb. Space Shuttle ?\n------------------\n\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\ndatafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):\n\nmodel1:\nA modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)\n\n406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)\n389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).\nPayload doors non-existent.\nUnits: unknown.\n\nSimon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He\nsaid there is no proprietary information associated with it.\n\nmodel2:\nThe newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in\n\ngondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub\/off\/objects\/shuttle.geo\nhanauma.stanford.edu ,  \/pub\/graphics\/Comp.graphics\/objects\/shuttle.data\n\nmodel3:\nThe triangles' model.\n\nThis model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.\n\nGreg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did\nnot mention any restriction on the model's distribution.\n\nmodel4:\nThe NASA model.\n\nThe file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,\ndefining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:\n\n<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>\n\nFrom then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions\n\n3473 vertices.\n2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,\n 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,\n 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).\nPayload doors closed.\nUnits: inches.\n\nJon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model\nProprietary info: unknown\n\nmodel5:\nThe old shuttle model.\n\nThe file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.\n\n104 vertices.\n452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).\nPayload doors open.\nUnits: meters.\n\nWe have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for\nsome years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor\nScott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.\n\n========================================================================\n\n16. Image annotation software\n=============================\n\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\n  rasterfile.\n\nb. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some\n  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not\n  sure exactly what they are.\n  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\n\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\n  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\n\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\n\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\n\nf. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based\n  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

All files (pub\/ice.tar.Z,\n  pub\/lxt.tar.Z and pub\/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed\n  tar format. pub\/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation\n  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).\n  A statically-linked compressed executable pub\/ice-sun4.Z for\n  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.\n\n  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not\n  be redistributed without permission.\n\n  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that\n  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of\n  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging\n  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.\n\ng. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the \n  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen \n  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many\n  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as\n  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib\/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest\n  X11 archive.\n\n========================================================================\n\n17.

This was\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\n  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a\n  freebie if you want it\"\n\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\n  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\n  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical\n  image processing which I've been doing.

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\n===================================================\n\nGRASS\n-----\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\n  capabilities.\n\n  Feature Descriptions\n\n  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  If you are willing to run A\/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\n\n  Availability\n\n  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\n\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\n  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\n  it and mail him comments\/corrections. The OGI is not currently\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\n\n  Support\n\n  Listserv mailing lists:\n\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\n\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\n  heavy GIS\/remote sensing flavor.\n\n  Feature Description\n\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\n  generic.  Complex Histogram\/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\n\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\n  for GIS applications.\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\n\nPCI\n---\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\n\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes\/groups\/packages of\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I\/O\" package is a set of utility\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\n  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't\n  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your\n  particular application\/interest calls for.\n\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\n  language programs which can interface with (read from\/write to) the PCI\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\n\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I\/O package offers a\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\n  graphic-arts industry's \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven't tried)\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\n  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\n  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\n\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould\/Deanza seems to come to\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\n  applications\/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac\/PC largely doesn't suffice\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\n  does a LOT of its land\/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\n  areas.\n\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\n--------------------------------\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\n\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\n\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X\n  for display.\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\n\nCLRview\n-------\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\n\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

What you are saying is\nmore or less heresy.  You might call it \"infallibilism\".  It's the\nidea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.\nThis is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.\n\nThe Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and\nwell-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can\nmake mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.\n\nA couple historical examples come to mind.\n\nBishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the\nEnglish Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning\nPope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop\nGrosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though\nmaybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even\nwhen they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just\ncollect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.\nThis would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop\nGrosseteste was quite right in what he did!\n\nAnother example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.\nHe decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific\nVision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a\ndefined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to\ndefining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic\ndoctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.\nHe went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In\nthe end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he\nrecanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the\nChurch.\n\nIf you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such\nsubjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you\nwill find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall\ninto heresy or schism.","target":3},{"content":"\nI totally agree with that sentiment.

We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1\/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1\/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.","target":2},{"content":"\n\nHow about:\n\n\tThe Holocaust\n\tThe Spanish Inquisition\n\tJonestown\n\n(just to name a few) ?\n\nAuthorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.

Note the early use of\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year's papers listed in the\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\n\n-- Eric\n\n\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\n\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\n\n\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\n\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\n\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\n\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\n\n\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\n\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\n\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\n\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\n\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\nthe original problem.\n\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \n\n\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\n\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\n\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\n\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\n\n\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\n\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\n\tother words, will it halt?\n\n\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\n\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\n\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\n\tout to be undecidable.\n\n\nI won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\n\nA couple of references might be:\n\n1.

By the well known\nDobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.\n37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to\nHamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an\nacronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no\nlonger be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to\ncomplete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)\n\n--------\n\nFrom: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)\n\nWell, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict\nyourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its\nsecond derivative.

For inputs the problem essentially\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \nthe object we \n\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\n\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\n\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\n\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\n\tmeasure.\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\n\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\n\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\n3) Depth sort the triangles\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\n\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\n\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\n\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\n\n\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\nthe edge of the surface.

I've known\nall sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to\nthe fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the \nconservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is\na (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone\nwho treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition.\nWhile I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official\nposition of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).\n\nThe particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in\nterms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use.

We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         \/  Nabil Ayoub                        ____\/   __  \/    ____\/  \/\n        \/  Engine Research Center             \/       \/   \/    \/      \/\n       \/  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___\/    __  \/    \/      \/\n      \/  University of Wisconsin-Madison    \/       \/   |    \/      \/\n     \/  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____\/ __\/   _|  _____\/  \/\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition.","target":3},{"content":"                                      ^^^^^^\nNo argument at all with Murphy.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time\/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits\/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits\/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"\/\"medium\"\/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet\/news.answers\/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet\/news.answers\/ftp-list\/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub\/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib\/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib\/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS\/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub\/jpeg\/viewers\/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386\/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG\/GIF\/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos\/graphics\/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS\/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning\/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/gif\/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos\/graphics\/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos\/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"\/pub\/msdos\/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file \/pub\/bryanw\/pc\/jpeg\/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos\/windows3\/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub\/pc\/win3\/desktop\/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS\/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check \/pub\/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n\/pub\/os2\/all\/graphics\/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS\/2 1.x.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion\/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS\/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n\/pub\/os2\/2.x\/graphics\/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG\/GIF\/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11\/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT\/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT\/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer\/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT\/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/art\/gif\/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG\/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file \/info-mac\/app\/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts\/mac\/quicktime\/qt.1.0.stuff\/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer\/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n\/info-mac\/app\/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under \/mirrors\/amiga.physik.unizh.ch\/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer\/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/edit\/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga\/os30\/gfx\/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG\/ILBM\/GIF\/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga\/gfx\/show\/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga\/gfx\/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file \/atari\/Graphics\/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to\/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read\/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory \/graphics\/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos\/graphics\/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM\/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n\/pub\/usenet\/news.answers\/compression-faq\/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF\/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF\/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF\/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG\/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression\/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression\/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1\/2 or 1\/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1\/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n","target":0},{"content":"-------------------------------------\n\t+ ............The OTIS Project '93  +      \n\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \n\t-------------------------------------\n\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\n\n\nWHAT IS OTIS?\n\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \nand distribution.

The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \n \nIf that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will \ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\n \nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.

After the image is received,\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\nare also welcome.\n\nOTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\ntougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \n\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \n\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \nemailing).\n\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.

If you have preferences as to what\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \n \nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\ncontact me and we'll arrange things.\n\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\nThis is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\nJPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather\nnot have to.\n\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\ncan stand.

It would be\nkeen of you.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUSE?\n\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\nyou'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \nArtists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have \nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for \nyou, or give you their contact information.\n \nWhen you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\ncompensation for their files.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNAMING IMAGES?\n\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something\nlike:\n \n\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\n\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\nremain intact on all systems.  \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\n\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\nsomewhere on or below the picture.

Space Science\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\ngenerate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at\nthe meeting. Here goes : \n\n\t\t\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\n\t\t\t-------------------------\n\n1. Introduction\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\n\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\n\n2.Design\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\n\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n3.Missions\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\nrate.\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\nbase, BTW]\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm\/m2 ensures that heat\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\ncontainer.\n\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\ninformation.\n\n\tAndy\n\n\n\n-- ","target":2},{"content":"I've a curiousity --\n\n  Whenever a person is put on the 15-day, 30-day or 60-day, \n the person is on the list longer than the specificed time\n\n  I've seen a person on the 15-day for maybe 4 months last year, I don't\n remember what...\n\n I just need a little clarification on the disabled list specifications.\n\n- Scotyy\n","target":1},{"content":"\nI was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a\nprofit, actually.

In\n    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three\n    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent\n    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these\n    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to\n    special 'servers'.\n\n    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of\n    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.\n\n    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central\n    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In\n    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for\n    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more\n    specialized mailing lists described below.\n\n    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin\n    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews\n    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a\n    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are\n    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',\n    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called\n    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends\n    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby\n    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so\n    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet\n    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was\n    posted.\n\n    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and\n    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not\n    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more\n    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make\n    it the preferred option.\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\n    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the\n    International Space University (in only its second change of management\n    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body\n    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note\n    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of\n    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are\n    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve\n\tjulius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub\/SpaceDigestArchive\/README\n    for further details.\n\n    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle\n    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line\n    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources\n    as they are released.

I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with\nat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his\/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.","target":3},{"content":"\n\tFirst of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I\nam threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all,\nalthough I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science\nhas nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--\nGod reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,\nScience.\n\n\tMy problem with Science is that often it allows us to\nassume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us\nwith the ability to produce life through sexual relations,\nfor example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.\nDoes that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision\nthrough alterations, that God wills for us to have the power\nto decide who should and should not be able to have \nchildren?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that\nis made possible.\n\n\tPeople have always had the ability to end lives\nunnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives\ninto the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially\ncreated life is artificially created death, and as God\nhas reserved judgement about when people should die to\nHimself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how\npeople should be brought in to the world.\n\n\tThis is not to say that I reject all forms of\nmedical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates\npain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly\nacceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus\nto cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely \nprolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary \nalterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  \ngo too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God\ngave us?\n\n\tI cannot draw a solid line regarding where I\nwould approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,\nbut I will say this:  Before one experiments with the\nuniverse to find out all its secrets, one should ask\nwhy they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body\nthey have been given, they should ask themseles why their\nbody is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot\nmake any general rules that will cover all the cases, but\nI will say that each person should pray for guidance\nwhen trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and\nshould cease their unravelling if they have reason to \nbelieve their search is displeasing to God.","target":3},{"content":"C-3's bird may be flaking out and expecting to die soon.\n\nor C-3  may orbit over  major users areas, and it may be\nneeded to provide  redundancy on that plane  while b-4  may orbit\nover hicksville, and not have muc of a user community.","target":2},{"content":"I am working on a project where we are going to be including\nboth still and moving grapics within a database.

Anyway...)\n\n\tThe basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of\nMary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles \nand all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their\nministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were\npresent when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days\nlater, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of\nthe other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was\nstill unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed\nthat Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their  \npreaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently \nconsidered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind\nby several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the\napostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down\nin the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the\nauthenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of\nthe assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.","target":3},{"content":"\n\nConsiderably better than I feel about, say, the Punic Wars, or the \nPeloponnesian War (spelling optional), or almost any other event in \nclassical history.

The training course will discuss the applications of\nsatellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment.\n\nThe training course, organised for the benefit of francophone\nAfrican experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space\nAgency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for\ncoordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing\nsatellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,\nselected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western\nand central Africa, and three regional African centres, will\nattend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote\nsensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1\ndata.\n\nThe ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991\nwith the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar\ninstrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing\nmissions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year\n2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the\npotential of experts using the practical applications of radar\nremote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy\nand the environment, with particular emphasis on applications\nto geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-\ncoastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.\n\nThe education and practical training programme was\ndeveloped jointly by the United Nations and ESA.

After the Turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter\nof time before the Empire fell, the inability of the Empire to hold onto\nthe rim of Anatolia, with the Ottomans and Rum Seljuks in the middle\nshould be quite obvious to any student of history.  The sack of\nConstantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  For if the Greeks\nhad wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the\nCrusaders when they came to do battle with the Saracens in the 1st-3rd\nCrusades?  Because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they\nconsidered heretics, even though those \"heretics\" were fighting for the\ncause of the Empire and Christendom in doing battle with the Turkish\nhordes in Anatolia, Edessa, Lebanon, Palastine, and Syria, the some\nhordes who were to later sack Constantinople, and overrun a third of\nEurope (the Balkans, Hungary, the Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.)","target":3},{"content":"\n\n\n\n\nDidn't one of the early jet fighters have these?\nI also think the germans did some work on these in WWII.\n\n\nA lot of this was also done by the military...\n\n\nWeren't the first microwave landing systems from WWII too?\n\n\nEgad!

Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\nmethods?\n \n > I don't recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\n \n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\ngoddess)?

There is a way.  Certainly it is not by human reason.\n Certainly it is not by human experience. (and yet it is both!)  To paraphrase\nSartre, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point.  It\nis only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing. \nYour logic comes to fruition in relativism.  \n\nAh, now it is clear.  Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often\nexplained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in\ncontemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus\n('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and\nimplicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of\nlanguage he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's\nthought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary\nframework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features\nremain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being\ntranscended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving\nus a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own\naccount, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that\nany critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to\ntalking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but\na threshold.\n  vonWrights's comment that Witt's \"sentences have a content that often lies\ndeep beneath the surface of language.\"  On the surface, Witt talks of the\ninsuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing\nourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with\nWitt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\n\n  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \n\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\n\n--Rex","target":3},{"content":"\n[insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little\nrelevance to what I've found]\n\nOK.

And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense\/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell.

To summarize:\n  \nSPACE ADVERTISING\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\n   - the GPS\/Navstar program office\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\na 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\nwould scan past it.)\n  \nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie \"The Last\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\nmain fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\ncoming from NASA.)\n  \nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".

We are not\nsaved by what we do.  However,\n\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\n(John 14:15).\n\nKeeping Christ's commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\nour love for him.  Also,\n\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\ncumbereth it the ground?\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\ndown.\n(Luke 13:6-9).\n\nAgain,\n\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\n(John 15:16).\n\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\nin the actions that we carry out.\n\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. \nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\npants is more important.\n\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\ncommands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit,\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \n\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\nprove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for\ndays about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a\nbuilding and not hit the ground.

Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\n\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\nsatellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\nslots.\n\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\nsupporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \nthe Pacific Rim. \n\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\n\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\n\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \nSiberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\n\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \nspecifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\ncompares to $810,000 t\/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\nnow.\n\nTidbits:\n\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\n\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\nwithin 9 months.\n\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20\/20, which is a huge retirement\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\n\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\npartly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don't worry \nbecause we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\nreally goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.\n\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\n\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\n\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\nhardware.\n","target":2},{"content":"\nTry FTP-ing at\n pub-info.jpl.nasa.gov  (128.149.6.2) (simple dir-structure)\n\nand  ames.arc.nasa.gov\nat \/pub\/SPACE\/GIF and \/pub\/SPACE\/JPEG\nsorry only 8 bits gifs and jpegs :-( great piccy's though (try the *x.gif\nfiles they're semi-huge gif89a files)\n                           ^^-watch out gif89a dead ahead!!!\nGood-luck (good software to be found out-there too)\n\nJurriaan\n\nJHWITTEN@CS.RUU.NL ","target":0},{"content":"Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at\nleast 10 at bats.\n\nIt is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.","target":3},{"content":"yeah,\n\nThey just tore down the Kmart near my house (putting in a new suptermarket).

Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\".\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or\nnight\" for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God.\"\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I'm mostly playing \"devil's advocate\".  I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.

Smith, D.D.\n                              (1894-1977)\n\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\n\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\n\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\n\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\n\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\n\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\n\n          How did this tomb become empty?\n\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\n     chimney at Christmas time.\n\n          But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\n\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\n\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\n\n          The facts are these:\n\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\n\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\n     the wrong tomb?\n\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\n\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\n\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\n               the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\n\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\n\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\n\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\n\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\n\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\n     the body of Jesus.\n\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\n     then proved.\n\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\n     of these men did.\n\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\n\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\n     what had happened to Him.\n\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\n\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\n\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\n     8).\n\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\n     appearances.\n\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\n\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\n\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\n\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\n\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\n\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\n     else had it.\n\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\n     us.\n\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\n\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\n     that His words are all true?\n\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\n\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\n\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.","target":3},{"content":"\nThe analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the \nquestion under discussion is not truth but arrogance. \n\nA similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood \ntransfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are \nJehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood \ntransfusion.

Can you stay away from eating meat?\nCan you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday?\nBuddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? \nCan you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing\nto give 1\/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think \nJesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a \nphilosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). \nConsidering the fact that Christianity is a young religion\n(compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very\nprobable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas.\n(There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the\nmiddle east at the time of Christ).\nAnd perhaps some more.

His explaination was that \nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \n\n\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \ncouple to be as one.\n\n\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\nanulments a half-hour later!!\n\n\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a\ncommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.\n\n\tBut I'm digressing....\n\n\t\t\tGod be with you,","target":3},{"content":"I would like to know if anyone has had any luck using the upper 128 ASCII\ncharacters on a Sun station.

I am not\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\n\tWhile the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\nreading the Bible.\n\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\n\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\n\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart].

I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\nreading many parts of the Bible.

For\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\n\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\nfrom past masters.\n\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\n\n     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\nless than many billions of dollars.\n\n     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us\nsome new\/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a\nSaturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.\n\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. \nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\nlittle, Test a little.\n\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\ndidn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\nALS\/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn't spend a\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\nthreat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\nit ran over cost or schedule.\n\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\nbudget.\n\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\n(See charts)\n\n     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's\nand 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\ncan't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\n\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\n\n     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You\nbring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.

In either\ncase a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution\nof linear equations).\n\nTo get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,\nP1 to P2, and setting the normal as the \"normalized\" vector from P1 to P2.\nThese just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.

But they have been systematically \n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \n\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \n          space and time: \n    \n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \n    \n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \n    \n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \n          DATUM\"). \n      \n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \n          BURSTS). \n          \n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \n          matter. \n\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \n          complex mathematics, in his books. \n    \n\n\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

This is the \n          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  \n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \n\n          \n\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background\n    \n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \n    \n               Larson's lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \n     \n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \n          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in \n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \n    \n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \n    \n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of \n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \n    \n    \n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \n          was\/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or \n          still is) President of Larson's organization, \"THE \n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \n          Minneapolis after retiring. \n    \n\n\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\n          \n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \n          value. \n    \n               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the \n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \n          with their environment. \n    \n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \n    \n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \n          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for \n          this WASTED money?! \n    \n     \n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \n    \n          \n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \n      \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\n          \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \n     \n               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \n          other. \n      \n               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \n          MATERIAL half. \n       \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\n          \n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \n          help \"prove\" Einstein's \"General Theory of Relativity\". \n    \n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \n    \n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \n     \n               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \n          about this.] \n    \n     \n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \n          ACCELERATION = FORCE \/ MASS, (a = F\/m).  Orthodox physicists \n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, \n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \n          FANTASY). \n    \n                                    \n          \n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\n\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \n    \n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \n    \n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \n    \n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \n          OPEN MINDS! \n    \n               The following is an example of his Theory's success: \n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's \n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \n    \n\n \n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\n\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \n          directional coincidence). \n    \n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \n          directions uniformly.) \n    \n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \n          stop it! \n    \n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\n          \n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \n    \n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \n          B. Larson. \n    \n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \n          and in some of his other books. \n    \n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal \n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \n          lighter elements. \n    \n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \n          of his books [better than I can]. \n    \n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \n    \n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \n          Diagram. \n    \n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \n          system, orbiting each other. \n     \n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \n    \n\n\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\n\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \n      \n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \n          his own version of Bode's Law. \n          \n\n\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\n\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \n    \n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \n          holes\", etc.! \n    \n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about \n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \n          to \"prove\" their theory. \n    \n    \n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical \n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \n    \n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's \n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \n          Unified Science). \n          \n          \n          \n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\n\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \n          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \n    \n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \n          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \n    \n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book \"NOTHING BUT \n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \n          \n               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are \n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \n          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \n    \n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \n          light! \n    \n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge \n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \n          rotation of the particle.) \n      \n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \n          generated in clouds. \n\n\n\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\n\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \n    \n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. \n    \n               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many \n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \n    \n               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.

So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from\nLeviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be\nignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).\n\nLater,\nMax (Bob) Muir\n\n[The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly\ncited passages are:\n\nthe story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and\nthere's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate\nposition on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the\nBible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known\nspecifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a\ncesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes,\nhomosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action\ndescribed.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about\nas many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of\nguests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically\nabout homosexuality.\n\nIn the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom\n1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.\nNote that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about\nidolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at\nleast result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this\npassage.  It does not use the word \"homosexuality\", and it is referring\nto people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.\nSo it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.\nBut it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway,\nthat Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards \nhomosexuality.\n\nThe other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim\n1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here\nmean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning,\nsuch as \"wanton\", and that another may be specifically \"male\nprostitute\".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about\nhomosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul\nshared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.\n\nJude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The\ncontext in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in\nSodom were angels, it seems likely that \"strange flesh\" refers to\nintercourse with angels.\n\nAs you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is\ndetermined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that\nthe passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT\nprohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT\nendorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no\nclear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in\nRom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly\ndo the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is\nlegitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his\nbackground and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.\n\nThis is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long\ndissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's\nclear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down\nto is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they\nbelieve that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This\nappears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a\nwhole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today.\nThis is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference\nbetween Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both\nsides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they\nkeep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the\nother side will finally come to their senses.

Chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my \ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\n\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\n\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \n\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.\n\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\n\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\n\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\n\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\nreligious community.\n\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\npew in front of us.\n\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\n\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\n\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\nwith her again.\n\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

Many men and\nwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.\nIs Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification\nwas NOT the will of GOD.

Yesterday was the most recent one;\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\n\nI'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\n\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\n\n\t- someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\n\t- someone's sick idea of flirting\n\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\n\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\nme some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\n\nI can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the\noffice.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\nwants to do to my body.\n\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\nleft in my desk drawer.\n\nI need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\nthat it's ridiculous.\n\nI feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel\nlike I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple\nphone call saying \"We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so\nthat Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...\"\n\nPlease pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously\nturned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing\nme so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\nisn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\ndo me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\n\nAnd please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this.\nThat's my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you're not worth\nanyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this\", \"you're right,\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\ncompany so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\n\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God.\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\nGod, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\nseparate one mentally from God.

In my follow-up to Jason Smith's posting, I will\naddress some issues that have caused misunderstanding:\n\n\n\n\nYes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic\non the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not\nescape your notice. \n\nThe correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and\ntheories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence,\nbut not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.\n\nHowever, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of\nphenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories\nscience has come up with have passed this test, including the Big\nBang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc.\nIt does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere\n'best fits' for the data. \n\n\n\nWell, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science\nrequires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if\nthe theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason.\nDisbelievers are not punished. \n\n\nThis is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_?\nMy fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is\nunable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God. \n\nYes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes\nthis quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not\nchange my situation. \n\n\n\n\n(deletions)\n\n\n\nNo, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy,\neither something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody\nwould ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \n\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \n\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\n\n\nI do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence,\nin general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still\nleave open the question \"why this, and not that\", and this is where\ntheistic explanations come in.\n\nScience cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.\n\n\nThis is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not?\nAlso, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has\nno meaning in His case. \n\nIf I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. \nFrom our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random\nreasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can\nI believe there is any better reason for my existence?\n\n\nYes, I am satisfied with this reason, until I find something better.\nMy 15 years of Christianity were of no help in this respect, I have\nto admit, but I am patient.\n\n\n\nNo, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists,\nfor an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this\nshould not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.\n\n\nIt is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question \n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\ntell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \n\n\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of\nthis spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that \nperspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who\nare inside it. \n\n\nNo. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think\nphilosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not\nknowable?\n\n\nThis is a very good question. In trying to answer this, and numerous\nother questions that bothered me, I finally found nothing to base\nmy faith on. \n\nI think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves, \"why do I believe\"\nor \"why I don't believe\". \n\nPetri\n","target":3},{"content":"   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks\n   >for sounding rockets?\n\n   Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the\n   tanks big enough.\n\nOur sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a\ntelescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\n\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\n\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\n\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\n\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\n\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\n\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\n\tin second stage.\"\n\n    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try\n    to interpret.\n\n    1)\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\n\n    2)\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\n\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\n\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\n\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\n\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\tThis causes a little bit of\n\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\n\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\n\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the\n\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\n\n    3)\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\n\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\n\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\n\tthe case if we didn't roll (\"performance gain\").\n\n    4)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\n\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\n\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\n\tcomplexity\").\n\n    5)\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\n\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\n\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\n\n    6)\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\n\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\n\n    7)\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\n\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\n\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\n\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\n\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\n\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\n\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\n\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the\n    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle\n    guy.)\n\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\tHe added that the \"roll\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\n    array.\n\n\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\n\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\n    for these viewers.\n\n    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\n    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.\n\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\n    missions and planetary encounters.

For\nexample, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \n\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\nscientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  \n\nI've heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\nprepared if necessary.  \n\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\nbeam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,\ngreat, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.\nBy making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps\nsomeone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the\ndata even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.\n\nI see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to\nplaces which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter\/Saturn Orbit,\nexiting the solar system, etc).   \n\nPerhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\netc) should consider designing in a \"pause\" mode in case their\nspacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of\nthe primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could\nhave some kind of routine written in for the post mission\n\"drift\" phase.\n\nSo any holes in all this?\n","target":2},{"content":"\n\nDid this happen to Jesus?

But these were\nmiracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - \"you've lost it!\"  The \"me\" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened\nto your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\n\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.

If you\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \n\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\n\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.

Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\nrequires work on our part.\n\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\noneself about believing in the first place.  \n\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\ndoing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\nJesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.

The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.\nThe author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but \"(at best) \nsecond-hand\".\n\n\t\"And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching\n\t Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and\n\t he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, \"Saul, Saul,\n\t why are you persecuting Me?\"  And he said, \"Who art Thou, Lord?\"  And\n\t He said, \"I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .\"\n\t\t(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)\n\nPaul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!

I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you \nthe Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know\nit is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?\n(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)\n\n\nThe Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?\nThe Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as \"inspired by God\", \nliterally means \"God-breathed\".  In other words, God spoke the actual words \ninto the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is \none that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and \nincompleteness of \"inspired by God\".\n\n\nThat's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a \nbook written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks \nof life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.\n\n\n\nWhat source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior\nhistoricity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings \nof the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.\n\n\nJesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.\n\n\nPlease rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your\ncurrent belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not\nonly did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards\nto C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?\n\tIn conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based\non gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims.  \nThe Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out.\n\tAbout your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the\nwriters, but he guides the reader as well.

He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.

Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.

This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\nthat the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\nof Christ's sinless body\"; she is \"God's Eden, in whom there is\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\n...\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\n...\n\nNow let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\n\nBaptism -\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\n\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\n power to think and to choose freely.\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\n title to enter heaven.\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\nfreely.\n\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\nbodies on the last day...\n\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):\n\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was:\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\n\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\n\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\n                definitely want to be with those He\n                has made _blessed_)\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\n\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\nand blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body\nof Christ and so,\n\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart.

With every truthful and good message that\ncarries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable\nfact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted\nway, with inevitable consequences.\n\nThe Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and\nthat all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of\nrepentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have\ndeceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message\naround and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways.\nThis is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.\n\nOne of the problems is that you look at the world through\nthe eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find\nmany, many cases of massacres that were instigated by\npeople who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying\nthis to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely\npointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.\n\nConsider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we\nwould have the same freedoms in the countries in which we\nlive, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ.\nPerhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion\n(I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which\nwould not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such\nsubjects.\n\nPoint the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for\npower, greed and hatred.

According\nto Luke 3:23\n\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\n   the son of Eli,\n\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\nintention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.\n\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\n\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \n\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\nnot Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.\n\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\n\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\ndetails are described in Steiner's \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\nMatthew\". \n\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\n\nAs for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\nline of descent from David, the king.","target":3},{"content":"\nCan anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for\nargument's sake, define \"rushed\" as brought up to the majors for more than\na cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below\nexpectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.

But\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\nperforming up to expectations?","target":1},{"content":"In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\nthat they are infallible.\n\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\nprobably agree.\n\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\nis no way out of the loop.\"\n\n\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\nleads to relativism.\n\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\n\n\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\n\n *\n\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\npoint at hand:\n\n\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\n\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\nin very limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\n\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\nget into trouble.\n\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\ncannot be certain.\n\n\n\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\n\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nto cover them up.\n\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\n\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\n\n *\n\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\n","target":3},{"content":"[William Christie asked about the Essene NT.\nAndrew Kille reponded\n--clh]","target":3},{"content":"I bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a\ngreat card especially with my multimedia presentations.

Well, I now have the\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\n\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even\/odd or non-winding rules to\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\n\n\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\n\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\n\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\n\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\n\n\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\n\t\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\n\t\tsome fancy fonts).\n\t2) It does not properly handle the even\/odd or non-winding rules.\n\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\n\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\n\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\nbevelled and\/or offset curves for font outlines?

Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity\/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS\/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle\/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle\/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle\/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO\/Spacehab\/COMET or SSTO\/SIF\/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas\/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover\/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n","target":2},{"content":"\n\n\nAmerican, perhaps, but nothing military about it.

My comments are based\nprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\nControversy\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\n\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\n \n[SECOND CENTURY\n\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\nThus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\n\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\n\n\nTHIRD CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nDynamic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Theodotus\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\nconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\nsense of the word.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\n'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\na hypostatic union.\nAsignation of Deity\/Eternality:\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\nwithout beginning or end.\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\ndoctrine of salvation.\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\nChurch.  --clh]\n\n \nModalistic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Praxeas\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\n(Jesus Only)\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\nAsignation of Deity\/Eternality:\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\nthe only unique and unitary God\n Son: Full deity\/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\nregeneration and sanctification.\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\n \n[I've moved the following description to be with the other\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\n\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\nAsignation of Deity\/Eternality:\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\nobservation of the simultaneous relational\/operational features of the\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\n\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\nthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\n\n\nFOURTH CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\n \nSource: Arius\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known\ncults\nPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\nAsignation of Deity\/Eternality:\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\nhe is not of the divine essence.\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\n \nOrthodox Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Athanasius\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\nPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\neternal.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\nAsignation of Deity\/Eternality:\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\nthe divine essence and function.\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\n\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

He's\ntelling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen\nbefore his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his\npower openly visible.\n\nBy the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me\nthat he is claiming to be Christ.","target":3},{"content":"If the  new  Kuiper belt object *is*  called 'Karla', the next\none  should be called 'Smiley'.","target":2},{"content":": 8~> I require BGI drivers for Super VGA Displays and Super XVGA Displays.

The dear old aunt (now \ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\ndevout.

Remember from stellar evolution that \nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\nthey don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the\ngalaxy.  \n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an \nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\nthese characteristics.

I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\n   stood by the Pope.\n\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\ndisobeyed.\n\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\n\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\n   authority and discipline.  \n\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\nbishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.\n\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\nhour, probably.\n\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\n\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\n\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\n\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\n\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\n\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\n\n\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\n\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\n\t the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\n\t don't jointly make such  choice.)\n\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\n   If I adopt the view that \"I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and\n   there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\n   I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\n\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an\ninstant non-Catholic.\n\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\ndoing, they would be shocked!\n\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\n\nThis isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\ndoctrine is.\n\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\n   I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)\n\nThat's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\nspread that it's pitiful.\n\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\nfact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\nrun.\n\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\n   Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand.\n   Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome,\n   one way or the other.\n\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\n\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\n   Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.","target":3},{"content":"I have seen several ray-traced scenes (from MTV or was it \nRayShade??) with stroked fonts appearing as objects in the image.\nThe fonts\/chars had color, depth and even textures associated with\nthem.

The new Eden will be\nthe sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His\nnext coming.\n    \nI relate the story again:\n    I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions  \n    in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these      \n    two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot     \n    the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the \n    children that she is afraid she's \"going to lose her\n    Son's arm\".  She is mourning too for these          \n    townfolks because it was their fault that there     \n    would be drought in their harvest; not much good    \n    food again this year as it was last year.           \n                                                        \n    Mary tells the children:                            \n*    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    *\n*    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  *\n*    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           *\n*    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          *\n    why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain.              \n    Then she asked them if they pray.  The children     \n    said \"hardly\".  She asked them to pray every        \n    morning and night.  When the children went back     \n    from work they had to tell somebody about this.     \n    When the news was spred and after thorough          \n*    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        *\n*    were converted and faith and obedience to God       *\n*    were restored in their community.                   *\n\n\nOnce again, the Lamb succeeds.","target":3},{"content":"\n","target":3},{"content":"\nWell, maybe it will be.

I believe all of the\npeople mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I\nfeel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to\ngo but that they would deserve it more. \n\nIMHO \nDave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\nthink it deserves some consideration.\n\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\n\nDarrell Evans - No.\n\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\n\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\n\n\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\n\n\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\nmaking a case for him. \n\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\nbring up his name.\n\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\nprobably will turn into a definately.\n\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\nthe possible votes.\n\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\n\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\n\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.","target":1},{"content":"\nCurrently, he's all over.

This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer\/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04\/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1\/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1\/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)\"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal?

But to suggest that a\n*disease* is a *punishment* for certain types of sin I think is \ntaking things much too far.  If we got some kind of mouth disease\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?  I dare\nsay all of us would be walking into walls.\n\nYes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real*\ncareful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for \nsin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\n\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\n\nIn case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\nno more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think\nit's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be,\nbut God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\nweight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\nher improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\n\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\n(or something like that).\n\nMay we all experience and accept God's grace.\n\n\n===============================================================================\nPaul Conditt\t\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\nApplied Research\tPhone:\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416\/3259\n  Laboratories\t\tFedex:\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\nUniversity of Texas\tPostal:\t  P.O.

To come up\nto speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and\/or ask for by\npersonality type summary file.\n\nOne observation is that people have significantly different personalities\n(no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect\nto church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while\nother people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more\nsolitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if\nconfronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of\npeople.  Of course this is measured by extroversion\/introversion.\n\nMy impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and\ncreate environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted\n(there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am\nquite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches\nto participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very\nuncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly\ninfluenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing.\n(BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both\npreferences have their place in the Body).\n\nMaybe I should define extrovert\/introvert more carefully since these words\nare usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert\/introvert\nscale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is\nexcerpted from my summary:\n\n1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:\n\n        Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside\n                          world of people, activities or things.\n\n        Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal\n                          world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.\n\n\nHopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can\nstructure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise\nthe Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities\nto fit them into a particular framework.

Cassini is a joint\n    NASA\/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV\/Centaur in October of 1997.\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's\n    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.\n\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\n    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\n\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\n    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\n    nature of Saturn's rings.\n\n\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\n\t -------------------------------------------------------------\n\t   10\/06\/97 - Titan IV\/Centaur Launch\n\t   04\/21\/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\n\t   06\/20\/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\n\t   08\/16\/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\n\t   12\/30\/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\n\t   06\/25\/04 - Saturn Arrival\n\t   01\/09\/05 - Titan Probe Release\n\t   01\/30\/05 - Titan Probe Entry\n\t   06\/25\/08 - End of Primary Mission\n\t    (Schedule last updated 7\/22\/92)\n\n\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

Now the\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\nsinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as\nwould God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"","target":3},{"content":"I don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you\ntrying to convince?

People tend to\ntreat church as they would a club and when something is less than to\ntheir liking, off they go to another one.\n\nI think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different \nperspective on the \"church choosing process\".

So, I think a better\nquestion is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where\nGod is trying to place me.\n\nIf a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they\ngo to is a logical first choice.

Some\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\n\n\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\ncustomer base.\n\n\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\ncommitments.\n\n\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years.

D1).  I thought I'd post it to\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What's New\" -\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\nwhat we can do *now*.   \n\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\n\n\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\n\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\n\nAt 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a\nmidlife crisis.\n\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\nrewards.  \n\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\npolicy.  \n\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\n\n.....\n\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\nto build space station Freedom alone.\n\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\n\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\nspace budgets.\n\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \n\n......\n\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\nslashed.

Qualifications -- one of the worse\nfinishes in last year's prediction contest.\n\nAL East -- 1993\n\n1.  Baltimore Orioles\nWhy the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to\nthis:\n  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.\n  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees\n  -- Milwaukee was a fluke\n  -- Indians aren't ready to contend\n  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better\n  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of \"replacement level\"\n\"But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.\"  No.  As a matter\nof fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division\non paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-\nbody has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  \"You don't really think that Brady\nAnderson is going to repeat, do you?\"  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction\non the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  \"Glenn\nDavis?  That's insane\".  Yes.  So, without further ado:\nSTRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.\nWEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be\n  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.\n  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize\n  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3\n  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.\nObPrediction:  \"The Streak\" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in\n  caught stealing.\n\n2. New York Yankees.\nSTRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American\n  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.\nWEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner \n  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far\n  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to\n  win a division.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.\nObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.\n\n3.  Toronto Blue Jays\nSTRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie\n  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.\n  Guzman.  Alomar.\nWEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.\n  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in\n  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.\nObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And\n  have a losing record.\n\n4.  Milwaukee Brewers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.\nWEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.\nWOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.\nObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.\n\n5.  Cleveland Indians\nSTRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy\nWEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix\n  Fermin.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.\nObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.\n\n6.  Boston Red Sox\nSTRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens\nWEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre\n  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL\nObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how\n  you will :->\n\n7.  Detroit Tigers\nSTRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker\nWEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.\n  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.\n  This year could be *very* ugly.\nWOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.\nWOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.\nObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.\n\nOne more division to go....\n-- \nDale J.

I came out of a church in which even the different\ncongregations were always competing and arguing about which one was\nbetter and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything\ninto practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've\nfound that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they\nare just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in\nJanuary when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this\nretreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even\nthe people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple\nthe previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One\nof the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only\none area in which disciples stand out from \"Christians\".  Also, another\npart of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of\nsome \"Christian\" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between\nchurches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of\nconviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be\nunified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along\ntogether.\n\nCreeds?  What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly\nbetter?\n\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going\nto be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those\nwho teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion\nand belief.  However, Scripture states:  \n   In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your\nmeetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when\nyou come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some\nextent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to\nshow which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).\n\nHow will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but\nbefore that, there are these qualities:\n   devotion to the apostles teaching\n   fellowship\n   communion\n   filling with awe for God\n   all having everything in common.\n   glad and sincere hearts\n   praising God\n   enjoying the favor of the people\nAll these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who\nhave these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, \"a man full of\nfaith and of the Holy Spirit\" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts\n7:54-60).  \n\n\nOne can say that a church is the true church only if that church is\nperfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I\nhave yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston\nChurch of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors\npointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is\ntotally sold out to God.\n\nAs for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may\nnever occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the\n\"true one\", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are\ndisciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they\nwill not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard\nnumerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there\nthat are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them\nany less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run\ninto someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement.\nI know I haven't.\n\nI must warn that this sounds cliquey to me.  A clique is a group which\nruns around together to some extent exclusively.  This causes problems\nin fellowship and causes divisions.  I would not say at all that this is\nsomething \"correct\" for a church\/group to do for any reason.  In one of\nthe churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of\npeople who were on the 14 different groups\/committees\/organizational\nheads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of\nthe committees and seldom were voted out of office without another\noffice being \"opened up\" so that they would have to step right back in.\nTheir degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he\nnearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he\nwould've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a\ndisciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be\nbroken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division\nwithin.  There's enough division without.\n","target":3},{"content":"\nI don't think you're going to be able to see the differences from a sphere\nunless they are greatly exaggerated.

There\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\nthat John would prefer.\n\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get 'em in and get 'em\nout\".\n\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}","target":3},{"content":"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\n \nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\nthrow home.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\nrocket ship.\n\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\nmid-June.\n\n        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\nmillion for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\nagencies.\n\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\nchanges in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\n\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\nprogram. \"I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\n\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\nevolutionary technology developments.\n\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\nshowed how today's engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\nparents' time.\"\n\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\n\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\ncrucial. \"It's essential we do not end up with a large management\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\n\n        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\nwe're going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't\nsustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\n\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\nwere left to the civil space agency.\n\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let's not\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!\"\n\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\n\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\ninvestments.\"\n\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\nAircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\n\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\nfeet.\n\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\n\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\n\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\nthrust\n\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\nturnaround.\n\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.","target":2},{"content":"on Date: Sat, 3 Apr 1993 12:38:50 GMT, Paul Dietz <dietz@cs.rochester.edu>\n\n\/in essence, holding a match under the nozzle, is just *nuts*.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\n\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\n\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\nit can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\ndocking system.\n\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\nlaunch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we\ndid with Skylab).\n\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\n\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\ndone to date.\n\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\nseems more likely.\n\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \n\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

To me, WIP tries\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\nin the sixth round.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\noptions list. Today's (4\/23) edition of the New York Times reports\nthat O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\n\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\ntoday's Times).\n\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\noption are:\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's\n     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\n     for the Air Force.\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\n     Shuttle\/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\n     source for 30 day missions.\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\n     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\n     add another 20 kW of power\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\n     Vehicle).\n\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\nhave all come to know and love :)\n\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\n\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter\/Spacelab, when\n     it visits.\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\n     assembly in 24 flights.\n\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\nchanges.","target":2},{"content":"The last state church was in Massachusetts.

It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I'm just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.

In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \nhardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \npast and present. \n\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \nto God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.\n\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \ntechnology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's  \nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \nMig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \npilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These  \neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\n\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim\/Croat\/Serb conflict in  \nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.\n\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\n\n1. The Second World War\n\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\n\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \n\t\t- Dresden, Hiroshima\/Nagasaki\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n2. Korean war\n\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\n\t  communism vs. capitalism.\n\t- Probably not justifiable.\n\n3. Vietnam\n\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\n\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\n\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\n\t- Probably justifiable.\n\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\n\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\n\t- Other factors such as genocide.\n\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\n\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\n\t- Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing'\n\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\n\t- Probably justifiable\n\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \nor Israel.\n\t- My feelings in this are simple\n\t- Nuclear war\/weapons are abhorrent\n\t- I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear\n\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\n\t- Never justifiable.\n\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I  \nwould appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture.

NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\tIt is not enough\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\n\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\n\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\t(DO NOT get a\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\n    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.\n\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\n    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\n    Keep your nose clean.\n\n    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\n\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\n\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\n    to demonstrate motivation.\n\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.\n\n\n\n\n    NASA\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\n    Houston, Texas\n\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\n    ==================================================================\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ---------------------------\n\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\n\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\n    considered.\n\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\n    program.\n\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\n    ---------------------------------\n\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\n    flight crew.\n\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\n    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\n    government agencies and private industries.\n\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\n    astronauts.\n\n    Pilot Astronaut\n\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\n    payload operations.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\n\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\n    experimental operations.\n\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\n    ===========================\n\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\n    --------------------------------\n\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\n    submitting an application.\n\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\n\n    1.

Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\n    specific standards:\n\n\t Distant visual acuity:\n\t      20\/50 or better uncorrected\n\t      correctable to 20\/20, each eye.\n\n\t Blood pressure:\n\t      140\/90 measured in sitting position.\n\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\n\n    Citizenship Requirements\n\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\n    the United States.\n\n    Note on Academic Requirements\n\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\n\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\n\tMedical Technology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\n\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\n\n    Application Procedures\n    ----------------------\n\n    Civilian\n\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\n\n\tNASA Johnson Space Center\n\tAstronaut Selection Office\n\tATTN: AHX\n\tHouston, TX 77058\n\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\n\n    Active Duty Military\n\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\n\n    Selection\n    ---------\n\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\n\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\n    their establishment.\n\n    General Program Requirements\n\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\n    their candidate period.\n\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\n    specified tour of duty.\n\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\n\n    Pay and Benefits\n    ----------------\n\n    Civilians\n\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\n    and experience.\n\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\n\n    Military\n\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\n    other similar military matters.\n","target":2},{"content":"Doug Roberts - Ken Hill for NL MVP!!\n\t       Let's go 'Spos\n","target":1},{"content":"\n   I agree with you.\n","target":0},{"content":"\nActually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,\nso it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.

I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so\nI'm going to wait a bit before calling names.\n\n\nI expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no\nidea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to\nrelease Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,\nOtto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out\na problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,\nand excruciatingly prolonged.)\n\n\nI think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to\ngive him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting\nso gloomy?\n\n\nNo he didn't.

Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which\nwas a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.\nMeanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a\nsix-year free agent before the 1992 season.\n\n\nTwice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.\n\n\nBut so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life\nof a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.\n\n\nBut he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his\ndisastrous 1992.

I don't know what he has or\nhasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.\n\n\nIt's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them\nto retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think\nbigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for\nJohn Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch\nlast year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something\nin 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement\nparts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to\nthe Bucs' future.\n\n\nDoes this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?

That which is authoratative is authoratative,\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \nopen to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\nan authority. \n\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an \nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \n\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \nverify for himself.\n\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\n\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \n\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny\nGod's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\nnature, prove anything.\n\n\n","target":3},{"content":"\nA 68070 is just a 68010 with a built in MMU.

Basically it changes things\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\n   other users.\n\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\n\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\n\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\n\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\n\n    o User Interface Panels\n\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\n\tfaster frame rates)\n\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\n\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\n\n  Server(s):\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\n\n    o Transparent Client Management\n\n    o Client Message Handling\n\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\naccepting and\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\napplication writer\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\n\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\n\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\n        initialisers you want.\n\n    o Event Handler Registration:\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\n\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\n\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\n    from which to choose.\n\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\n\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\n        any initialization you want to do.\n\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\n\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\n\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\n\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\n\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\n    three world servers I've provided:\n\n        generic - 81 lines\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\n                           stairs!

I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w\/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.

Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started \nwith a solid single to right, moved to second on \"Bob\" Kelly's infield sneaker\ndown the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a \nrare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.\n\nCincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only \ngiven up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double\nby Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after\nJoe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who \nargued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by \"drawing the line\" (really, he\nshould know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting\ntossed.\n\nThe Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must \nhave been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's\nsingle, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell\nand turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson\nfailed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:\n\nSaberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield\nto discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:\nThompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.\n(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)\n\nThe Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's\nground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back\nsingles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long\nfly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but\nthird base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was\nhung out to dry killing the Reds rally.\n\nRob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner\non second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game\nin late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on\nDibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended\nup walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a \nweek, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went\nto Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings\nwork, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit\nsurprised he even pitched in the eighth.

(WCAU is\nanother strong station, now it's an oldies station, but they still\nhave the Phillies) I started listening to the FAN because I heard he\nwent there.  I finally heard him last summer and he wasn't the same\nguy.  Those NY fans got to him.  I was glad to hear him back in\nPhilly when I went to see a few Eagles games.  \n\n\nI will admit, I am  die hard EAGLES fan and WIP is basically an\nEagles station 365 days a year.  BUT, I bet you the Phillies are in\ncontrol right now.\n\n\nAbout the knock on G. Cobb, I like him.  He knows the Eagles like a\nbook.  I remember the weekend before they went to play San Fran,\n(when everyone thought the Eagles would be blown away) Cobb said that\nthe Eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.\nWell they were inches shy of pulling the victory.  ","target":1},{"content":"According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking \"in X's\nname\" is a standard Aramaic\/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today\nwould call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized\nto conduct business \"in John's name\" had full authority over John's\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n\"in John's name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus' name\" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus' name\" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus' name\" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus' Name\" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to\ncontradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His\nomniscience and grace.\n\nVan Kelly\nvek@research.att.com\n","target":3},{"content":"Guess the subject says it all.\n  I would like references to any introductory material on Image\n  Databases.\n  Please send any pointers to mini@point.cs.uwm.edu\n\n  Thanx in advance!\n   \n\n\n","target":0},{"content":"\nNeil Gehrels is Prof. Tom Gehrels son.

It is a\nbit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you\nanyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might\nbenefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.\n \n=======================================================================\n \n                   D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?\n \n \nQ. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs,\n   tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, \"God Loves You.\"  Isn't\n   that true?\n \nA. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read\n   in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:\n \n      For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten\n      Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but\n      have everlasting life.                               John 3:16\n \n \n      The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he\n      loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9\n \n      For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of\n      the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6\n \n \nQ. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good\n   I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How\n   can these verses apply to me?\n \nA. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is\n   looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The\n   Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven.\n   On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before\n   God.\n \n      As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There\n      is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after\n      God.                                            Romans 3:10-11\n \n      The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately\n      wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9\n \n \nQ. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?\n \nA. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will\n   come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.\n \n      For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the\n      lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase,\n      and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap\n      mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They\n      shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,\n      and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of\n      beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.\n                                                Deuteronomy 32:22-24\n \n \nQ. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not\n   that bad.\n \nA. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ-\n   ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\n \n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\n \n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\n \n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\n \n \nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\n \nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands\n   payment for sin.\n \n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\n \n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\n \n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\n \n \nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\n \nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\n \n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\n \n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\n \n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\n \n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\n   Hell anymore?\n \nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\n \n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\n \n \nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\n   Hell?\n \nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\n \n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\n \n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\n \n \nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\n   followers also go to Hell?\n \nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\n   save us.\n \n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\n \n \n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\n \n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n                                                          1 John 1:9\n \n \nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\n \nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\n \n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\n \n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\n \n \nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\n \nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\n \n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\n \n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\n   the only Word of God.\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\n \n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\n \n \nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\n \nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\n \n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\n \n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\n   Hell.\n \n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\n \n \nQ. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\n \nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\n   ure.  Salvation is\n \n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\n \n \nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\n \nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\n   more.\n \n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\n \n \nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\n \nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\n   more.\n \n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\n \n \nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\n   come?\n \nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\n   save.\n \n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\n \n \nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\n \nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\n \n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\n \n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\n \n \nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\n \nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\n \n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\n \n \nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\n \nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\n \n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\n \n \nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\n \nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\n \n \nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\n   ment?\n \nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\n   become very short.\n \n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\n \n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\n \n \n \n \n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\n \n \n \nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

While none of us is guaranteed\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n","target":3},{"content":"Does anybody know what Delaunay Triangulation is?\nIs there any reference to it? \nIs it useful for creating 3-D objects?

Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\n\"throne\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\n\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\nsensibilities.\n\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\npoint of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\nwouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\n\nI'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\nisn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. \nIt's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\n\n\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\nrepentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \n\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\neternality.\n\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\n2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\n4) Christ.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\nThat were not done and now we have\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\n -the program has human interface errors.\n\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\n\n[ ..deleted.. ]\n\n==clip==\n\nSome new items follows.\n\n==clip==\n\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\noption than with default option we have.\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\n\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\n(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly\n-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.\n\nI don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.\nSo, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.\n\nI suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in\nrlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.\n(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I\ncan say nothing about it.)\n\n==clip==\n\n==clip==\n\nSome minor bugs in human interface are:\n\nKey pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens\nthat I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong\nplace. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about\nfive minutes and then it is gone away immediately.\nThe buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.\n\nAlso, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard\nand mouse for XV after the image is completed.\nOften it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when\nI'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first\nand then get the updated image.

I've got a problem that \nI need as many people's help from as possible.\n\nBefore I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell\nyou that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy\nmeets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...\n\nOK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\nher name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have\nbeen writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about\n2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago. \n\nBy the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.\n\nOK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming\nback to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\n(She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \nmention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she\nknows I am a Christian. \n\nWell, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such\na thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid\nyou not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.\n\nIn out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding\ndates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her).\nShe has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended\nup leaving school....Now we are at the present...\n\nLet me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....\n\n\n\"Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not\ngoing to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College\njust wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and\nthat just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested\nme & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was\ninterested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with \nkids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents\ncould tell.\n\n\"So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now\nI have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room\nM-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and \nit's great experience.\n\n\"As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very\nnear future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to\nstudy. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of\nyears. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be\nto Kansas.\n\n\"Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district \nmanager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for\nabout 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll \nbasically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to \nchose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\nWhat do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.\n\n\"This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay\nand any thye of management experience would look good on an application\nor resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good\nbenefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time\nservice, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng\nfor me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up \npaying out of state tuition wherever I go.\n\n\"Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I \nrespect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for \nsoooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really \ngood. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want\nto do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something.\nI don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female\nis too bad. \n\n\"Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now,\nMARRY ME...\n\n\"You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously\n(or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the\nhome life later.\"\n\n***********\n\nOK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you\nthink she meant about the marraige thing?? \n\nI dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her\nletter!!! I don't know what to think??\n\nSince she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a \nBass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???\n\nI always pick on those people who graduate from high school and\nget married....but what does she mean??? \n\nI've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that \nI don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that\nmost college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the\nGreeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here\nshe says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!\n\nMaybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am\nso attracted to paying some real attention to me.\n\nI mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm\nonly 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through\nclasses..\n\nI have prayed about this over the past year from time to time..\nsaying, \"God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..\"\n\nCould this be my sign???\n\nI would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes \nit worse..\n\nShould I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone.

Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly.

Matthew\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\n\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\n\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\n\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\n    geological and biological sense.\n\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\n    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\n    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\n    of an ocean.\n\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\n\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\n    launcher autopilot failed.\n\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\n    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\n\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\n\n\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\n\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\n\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\n\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\n    to do so.\n\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\n    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\n    its batteries failed.\n\n\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\n\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\n\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\n\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\n\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\n\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\n\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\n\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\n\n\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\n\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\n\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\n\n\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\n\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\n\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\n    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.\n\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\n\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\n    down on April 12, 1980.\n\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\n\n\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\n\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\n\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot\/band cycle\n    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\n\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\n\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\n    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)\n\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades.

Was\n\t     also a test for future Mars missions.\n    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images\n\t     from surface.\n    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.\n    LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966.\n    ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8\n\t     accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were\n\t     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.\n    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil\n\t      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in\n\t      1972.\n    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's\n\t      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished\n\t      with LUNA 21\/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973.\n    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in\n\t      1976.\n\n\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\n\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\n\t       lost enroute in 1961.\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\n\t       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in\n\t       February of 1966. No images were returned.\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\n\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\n\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\n\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\n\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\n\t       similar in 1969.\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\n\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\n\t       1972.\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\n\t       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar\n\t       mission.\n    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.\n\t\tVENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.\n    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of\n\t\tplanet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.\n    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian\n\t     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on\n\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\n\t     March of 1986.\n\n\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\n\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\n\t     enroute the following year.\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\n\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\n\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\n\t     Planet in 1971.\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\n\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\n\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\n\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\n\t     probe MARINER 9.\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\n\t     with its flyby bus.\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest\n\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\n\t       human\/computer error.\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\n\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\n\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\n\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\n    space program remains to be seen.\n\n\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\n\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field\/plasma waves\/solar wind, all of\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\n\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\n\n\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\n\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March\n    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\n\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\n    approach:\n\n\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\n\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\n\tInclination\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\n\tPeriod\t\t: 4.7 days\n\n\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\n\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\n\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\n    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works\n    can also be purchased in and\/or ordered through any good mass- market\n    bookstore.\n\n    General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):\n\n      J.

Good university libraries will carry\n    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission\n    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study\n    some of the books listed above.\n\n    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL\n    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's\n    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,\n    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER\n    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the\n    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\n    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions\n    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and\n    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major\n    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,\n    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events\n    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are\n    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you\n    probably know.\n\n    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you\n    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space\n    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their\n    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe\n    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\n\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I\n    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas\n    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from\n    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.\n\n    Larry Klaes  klaes@verga.enet.dec.com","target":2},{"content":"\n\nIf not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, I'd swear that\nMcElwaine had changed his name and moved to Cal Poly.

I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That\nSpoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no\nreference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of\nresurrection. Modern Evangelicals\/Fundamentalists have completely missed what\nthe point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work \n_Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ\nCambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul\nhere has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there\nis no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared,\nno ascension either.\n\nResurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the\ngrave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts\nuntil well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up\nwith a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly,\nI think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts\nbefore this which mention the tomb). \n    \n\n\nYou are quite right here.  Even the Idea of a subjective mystical event as the\nfoundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more untenable.\nSee B.

I've \ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \ngranted to copy this without restriction.\n\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1\/3\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\n\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\nIllinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\nthey aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\n\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\n                  ______\n3 G         \/|   \/      |\n           \/ |  \/       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \n          \/  | \/        |\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\n2 G      \/   |\/         |          made by the  \/  should be curves which are\n        \/               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\n       \/                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.\n1 G   \/                 |\n                        |\n                        |\n0 G                     |\n\n             ^          ^\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\n\n\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\nout entirely.\n\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \nthat desired.\n\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\n\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\n    all at once?\n\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\n\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\n\nA:  Can't tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \n\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\n\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about \n60 degrees south latitude.\n\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that\naspect of the flight profile.\n","target":2},{"content":"Please Ineed information about desk top publishe- post graduate courses\nand if possible email address or normal mail.\nthanks in advance\n","target":0},{"content":"\nI do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few\nyears back and I can't cite the specifics.

This form of\n*conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in \nwhich people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate\nto one another and to God.\n\nIMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served \non the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in \nwhich Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker \nin federal prison.","target":3},{"content":"What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and\nthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.

It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\ncomparisons.

My\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.

In the last few\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \npresent to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.\n\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\n(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\nliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\npeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.\n\nSo we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\ngoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \nof God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?","target":3},{"content":"I'm not very impressed by the old so-called \"prospecting\" work from\nLPI, it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on\nthe moon as an excuse to put astronauts there.

Then, I point out that I am\nnot clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly\ninterpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,\ncan I, Fred?

Instead you have provided a good reason\nto ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations\nthat you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more\nmeaning than they ever should have had.\n\nMy reading of what Nick actually said is that \"people aren't required in\nall parts of all space processes\", so your taking issue with his opinions\nregarding people in the space program, I read as \"People are required in\nall parts of all space processes.\"  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm\nso patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat\nyour terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and\nstring models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)\n\nThe point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.

But, alas, that's your\njob, Fred.\n\nAnd, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,\nsimultaneously, with an allegory\/insult.

If you do, consider that you saw\nme come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.\nIf you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went\ndown exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's\njust amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's\nno worse than your own.\n\nLet's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,\nwhile your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my\ncomplaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling\nisn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might\nsee it better, Fred.\n\n\"Net.ghod wannabe\"?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my\nmotivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as\nyour insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about\npeople that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to\nimpress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private\nmail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a\njerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.\nAlas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and\nbringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable\npurpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried\nto make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to\ncommunicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.\n\nWell, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job\nwith NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,\nI just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m\/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm\/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km\/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km\/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n","target":2},{"content":"\n[deleted]\n\n\nKeep in mind this was in Massachussetts.

Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in \"Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy,\" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA\/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA\/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA\/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms\/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms\/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms\/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you're dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team's medical\/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\nworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, \"better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead.\" (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\n\n\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\n\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\nthe sense world.\n\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\npeople's ideas of life after death.\n\n\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at \"the turning point of\ntime\" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\nmuch more as well.\n\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\nviews on this subject).\n\n\nThe way you refer to it as \"doctrine\" puts a modern intellectual coloring\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\nteachings today can be received.\n\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\nexpression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\n\nIndeed.

While\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow\" (John 16:12).\n\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\n\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu","target":3},{"content":"This just in...\n\nNolan Ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the Rangers-Orioles\ngame last night.

Capitalism arose at the\nsame time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy.\nThis doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it\nbegan to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European\nsociety and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\njustified\n them.\n\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \"economics\" -\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \"the free\nrein of the market mechanism\", while for others it was \"the\ndialectical forces of history\". But in both the capitalist West and\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\noppose what was happening and state their case.\n\nSteve","target":3},{"content":"\n\n\n\nWell, I think that most Christians believe that your conciousness will\nsomehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what\nmost atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness,\nbeing contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.\n\n\nI fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying, but since I\nwon't be around to worry about it, I don't fear eternal death.\n\n\nThis is something I've always found confusing.

The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,\nRuth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote\nfrom the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not\ndisqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.  And the\nWisodm of Solomon was quite clearly an influence on St. Paul, especially\nin the letter to the Romans (cf especially Romans 1.18-32 and Wisdom\n13-14).\n\n[stuff deleted]\n\n \nTrue.  Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the\nbooks of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole\nargument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not\nuniversally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and\nothers were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for\nthe Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the\nDeuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I\nthink) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of\nBaranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament\nonly, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.\n\n\n\n\tYou're not wrong!  It is a `tradition of men' to exlcude them, as I\nwill explain below.\n\n\"That nothing be read in the Church under the nmae of Divine Scripture,\nexcept the canonical Scriptures, and the canoncial Scriptures are -\nGenesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth,\nFour books of Kingdoms [being 1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Kings], Two books of\nParalpomenon [being 1&2 Chronicles], Job, the Psalter of David, the Five\nbooks of Solomon [being Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Wisdom of\nSolomon, and [misatributed to him] the Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach],\nThe books of the Twelve (Minor) Prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah [being\nJeremiah, the Lamentations, Baruch, and the Letter, all of which were\nformerly counted as one], Ezekiel, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Esther, Two\nbooks of Ezra [being Ezra and Nehemiah], Two books of Maccabees.  And of\nthe New Testament: Four books of the Gospel, One book of the Acts of the\nApostles, Thirteen letters of Paul the Apostle, One Letter of the same\nto the Hebrews, two of Peter the Apostle, Three of John, One of the\nApostle Jude, One of the Apostle James, One book of the Apocalypse of\nJohn.\"\n\t-Council of Hippo, Statute 36, (393 AD)\n\n\tThis same list was promulgated again at the Third Council of Carthage\n(397 AD), and at the Sixth Council of Carthage (419 AD) - at which\ncouncil the same list was enumerated with the words \"Because we have\nrecieved from the Fathers that these are the books to be read in the\nChurch.\"  Which ought to quiet those who assert \"in the name of Holy\nScripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was\nnever any doubt in the Church,\" as the Episcopal Church does in removing\nthe Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians\nhold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not\ncounted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The\nLutherans hold out similarly.)\n\tEarlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also\nbe found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it\ndivine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.\n\n\"And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as\nconsisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the\nnumber of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also\nthat by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books,\ncorresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks.\"\n\t-St. Hillary of Poitiers, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" prologue, 15 (365 AD)\n\n\"The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with\nLamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is\nMaccabees.\"\n\t-Origen, \"Commentaries on the Psalms,\" Psalm 1 (245 AD)\n\n\"Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to\nthe boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows].\"\n\t-St. Clement of Alexandria, \"The Instuctor of Children,\" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)\n\n\"....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ...

Both Astacio AND Martinez\nwere bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.\nMartinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might\nhave seen him lifted in the third in past years.\n \nAstacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.\nThe Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls\nin the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great\non defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to\nsteal and has at least one pick off at first.\n \nWallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on\ndefense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers\nsome runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.\nI suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw\nseem to have come out of theirs.","target":1},{"content":"Archive-name: space\/diff\n\nDIFFS SINCE LAST FAQ POSTING (IN POSTING ORDER)\n\n(These are hand-edited context diffs; do not attempt to use them to patch\nold copies of the FAQ).\n\n===================================================================\ndiff -t -c -r1.18 FAQ.intro\n*** \/tmp\/,RCSt1a06400\tThu Apr  1 14:47:22 1993\n--- FAQ.intro\tThu Apr  1 14:46:55 1993\n***************\n*** 101,107 ****\n\t\t  NASA Langley (Technical Reports)\n\t\t  NASA Spacelink\n\t\t  National Space Science Data Center\n-\t\t  Space And Planetary Image Facility\n\t\t  Space Telescope Science Institute Electronic Info.

Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n\nI can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.

The properly-formed conscience can\nbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something\nso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess\nanything trustworthy?

To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\n?cannot be certain.\n\nThis argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a\nconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me\nof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of\na measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying\nto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\nnot subject to the experimental method. \n\n?Darren F Provine \/ kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n?\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\n?

Here's a very simele question to which\nI'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please\nanswer yes or no, Roger:\n Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?\nAL only, please.\n\nFor anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact\nthat a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the\nteam scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,\nhard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a\nrule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,\nfor every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.\nSo, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that\nthey scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other\nthings being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack\nMorris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238\nfor Boston), the \"Red Jays\" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or\nenough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola\npitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in\n(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you\nreally do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs\nhis team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this\nanalysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would\nnecessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but\nthat is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and\nevaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that \"had Morris\nperformed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.\"\n\n\nThis is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.\n\n Mike Jones | AIX High-End Development | mjones@donald.aix.kingston.ibm.com","target":1},{"content":"Hello,\nI purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously \nSpeedstar 24 compatible.

Even the\ngreatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical\noddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust.\nMankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness\nthat transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the\nend.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little\npurposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others)\nsuffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at\nleast able to put it out of their minds.\n\nTo me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the\ntrue reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is\na school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That\ngives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure\noff.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms\nif you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress,\ngrow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your\nlove, especially when it's dificult to do so.  Honest effort is rewarded\nby God, he knows our limitations.\n\n\n\nInteresting theological question.  I have a feeling that most common\nperception of eternal life is WAY off base.

This was a\nheresy that was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD.  It\ngrew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus\nare two different people who happened to be united in the same body\ntemporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia\nand by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes\nthat Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is\ncorrect), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had\nonly one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the\northodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two\nenergies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect\nharmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus\ncame in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human\nwill.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to\noriginal sin.\nIt is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this\nconflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but\nnot two wills or two energies.

An automated data \nprocessing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of \norbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail \nechoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, \nthey showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----\nobservations using a much higher frequency.

(Kyoto Univ., Japan); KATO, S.\nKyoto Univ., Uji (Japan). Radio Atmospheric Science Center.\nIn International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program.\nHandbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p\nPublication Date: Jun. 1986\n      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere \ntroposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar \nfeatures an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large \nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \ndivision\/combination are performed at a low signal level using \nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \nand results are discussed.\n","target":2},{"content":"I was wondering if anyone knows where I can get more information about\nthe graphics in the WingCommander series, and the RealSpace system they use.\nI think it's really awesome, and wouldn't mind being able to use similar\nfeatures in programs.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\n\n\t2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A\/G) maintain is\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\nto be a Christian.

From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\n\n\nCouldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\nto.\n\n\n\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\n\n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \nLook at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\ninteresting study.\n\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\n\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\n\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \"Egyptians.\"  He really\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\nEgyptians. \n\n\nI'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.

Guy didn't hit a lick, had\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't \nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\nOBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \n\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  \n\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been \na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \n\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you \nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\n\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.\n\n\n\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?\n\n\n\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\n80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\n\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\nstiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\nSS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.\n\n\n\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.\n\tSkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\nabout Morris' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris' \"ability\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned \nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\n80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\nnot favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\n\"consideration\".  \n\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's \njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\n(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)\n\tPuck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \ntragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the\nleague.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.\n\n\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \nor not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  \nintends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  \nChrist is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  \nserve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  \nthe bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world\/have  \nalready died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.\n  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  \nthere is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  \ntolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  \nlive with him on the wrong in your life. \n  Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  \nChristian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  \npenalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  \npunishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  \npunishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  \n3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  \nthrough him it might be saved.\" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  \nwith painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  \nagainst me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  \nthey are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  \ndis come in Jesus of Nazereth.

I have started looking into these  \nthings and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all  \nhis questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different  \ntack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post  \nsome more info soon.\n\nOur duty to our neighbour:\n\nDo good to all men (Gal 6:10)\nLove our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)\n\nAct the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in  \ntrouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured  \nman, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes  \npeople harm (even medical corps of the army etc).\n\nChristians are by faith \"citizens of the commonwealth of Israel\"  \n(Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that \"God rules in the kingdoms of  \nmen\", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles  \nof those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.\n\nWe are to be \"strangers and pilgrims\" amongst the nations, so we are just  \npassing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations  \n(this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We  \nare not supposed to \"strive\" or \"resist evil\" (even \"suffer yourselves to  \nbe defrauded\") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in  \npreserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up  \nGod's kingdom.\n\nOur duty to the state.\n\n\"Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God  \nthe things which be God's\" (Luke 20:25).\n\"Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power  \nbut of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth  \nthe power, resisteth the ordinance of God\" (Rom 13:1-2).\n\"Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether  \nit be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing  \nye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men\" (1 Pet 2:13-15)\n\nThese scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a  \ndivine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any  \nordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to  \nit. The reason for this is that we are God's \"bond servants\" and His  \nservice is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col  \n3:22-23 where bondservants were to \"work heartily as unto the Lord\" - so  \nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \"Pressed down, shaken  \ntogether, and running over\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\n\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is  \nnot fighting in the battle, but is \"testifying\" to the truth.\n\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \"fellow  \ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\", and are no longer  \ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to \"lay aside every weight\" that we may  \nrun \"the race that is set before us\", and if we are wise, we will discard  \nany association which would retard our progress - \"Thou therefore endure  \nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \nchosen him to be a soldier\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\n\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is \"be ye not unequally yoked  \ntogether with unbelievers\". One of the obvious applications of this is  \nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \nservitude, and Jesus says \"take my yoke upon you\", so we are then yoked  \nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \"become not ye the  \nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\n\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \n\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\". The situation here is a good  \nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \"sold himself to work  \nwickedness before the Lord\" (1 Kings 21:25).\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \n\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \nyoking.\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil  \nassociation he had made.\n\nGod says to us \"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \ndaughters\" (2 Cor 6:17).\n\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into  \nit, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\n\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\n\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\n\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\n\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\n\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\n\nAll that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \nmaster.\n\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \nanyone but God.\n\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor  \n10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).\n\nI'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit  \nfurther.\n","target":3},{"content":"\nYes.\n\n(I am adamantly an environmentalist.

Therefore the earth is\nnot God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is\nGod.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.\n\nI see two facets of a response to it:\n\n1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is\n   God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because\n   showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not\n   constitute what the Apostle Paul called \"becoming all things to all men so\n   that by all possible means I might save some.\"\n\n   Don't say \"Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time\n   on.\" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your\n   credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.\n\n2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not\n   creator.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\n\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\n   provided for in canon law.\n\nHere's some of the theology involved for the interested.\n\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's \"schism\"; often the\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\n\n- true obedience\n- false obedience\n- disobedience\n- schism\n\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\n\n1) a command\n2) the response made to the command\n\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\n\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\n\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\n\ncommand         response            name\n-----------------------------------------------------\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\n\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\n\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance\/refusal.  The nature of\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\nconsider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\n\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!\n\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\n\nAnd there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\ncourse disagreed.\n\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\n\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\n\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\nleast, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\nbadly.\n\nSchism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?\n\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so\nit doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with\nthe Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.\n\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\n\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find:\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\ncommand.\n\nHere's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\n\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\n\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\nday.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.\n\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\n\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\nHoly Father's motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It's the\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\nPapal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope\nhimself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.\n\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\n\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\nconstituted a schismatic act.\n\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\nof Tradtion.\n\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.\n\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\n\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\n\nThe Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\nThere's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\n\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's\nthe passage in question:\n\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\n\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\n\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\n\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\n\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\nbe simplified to the following:\n\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\n- I am the Pope.\n\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\nThis is weak, to say the least!\n\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\nArchbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\n\nI don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\n\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\n\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\ndiscipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\nthat you say defines schism.","target":3},{"content":"\n\n\n\n\n   Anaheim.","target":1},{"content":"From article <C5owCB.n3p@world.std.com>, by tombaker@world.std.com (Tom A Baker):\n\n\nMy understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically\nknown bugs in the warning system software - things are checked\nthat don't have the right values in yet because they aren't\nset till after launch, and suchlike.

She was a cheerful\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\n\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\n    on\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\n    Eucharist.\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\trest  of  the\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\n    until\n\n\t\t\t\t   -4-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.\n\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\tMaria\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\n    did the Holy Will of God.\n\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\ttwice\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\tlived\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\n\n\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\n    handkerchief,\"  as\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\n    91\/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\n    him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\ttouch\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\n    held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.\n\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\t\"No I\n    will  not,\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\n    knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\n    of the baby Teresa\ton  the  landing  brought  the\tattention  to\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\n\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\taway.\n    As\tthe  ambulance\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\n    Communion\n\n\t\t\t\t   -5-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\n    in\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\n    died at about three o'clock.\n\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par-\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\n    in\tMaria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.\n\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\tus  to\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\n\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\n\n\n    by Brendan Arthur\n","target":3},{"content":"\n: 3DO is still a concept.\n: The software is what sells and what will determine its\n: success.\n\n\nApparantly you dont keep up on the news.  3DO was shown\nat CES to developers and others at private showings.

Paul adapted the\nmessage of the Bible to a largely uneducated market. Granted, this\nmarket still exists today, but do you count yourself as part of it?

On what basis? Are we extra-biblical at this\npoint? Why not also acknowledge that the Bhagavad-Gita is the only\nrelevant text for Gentiles, after all we see in the Bible that it was\nMagus from the east who observed the star-signs of Jesus? Why bother\nwith any texts at all? Why not just follow whatever the Church has to\nsay?\n\n\nI don't see how you can say this with a straight face. Are you a\nfollower of Christ, or do you follow someone else? Are you saying that\nthe words of Jesus only apply to Jews?\n\n\nHow Jewish was Paul after he changed his name from Saul?\n\n\nWho says Gentile Christians are not covered by the first five books? Who\nsays that Gentile Christians are above the Ten Commandments?\n\n\nYou're implying that Jesus' words are valid only for Jews. Is this\nreally what you mean to say? You do realize that you are gutting rather\nlarge portions of the Bible? When you read Jesus' words, did you ever\nconsider that maybe, just maybe Jesus is talking to you, no matter what\nyour race or sex? If the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospel accounts of\nJesus are only directed to Jews, why were they translated into English?\n\n\nAs Paul would call him, one who was weak in the faith.\n\n\nWhich is more important: 1) The recorded word of Jesus or 2) Indications\nthat you can deduce from the Bible? Was Jesus God only of the Jews, or\nGod of all humankind of all race and sex?\n\n\nThis is your understanding of Paul. Compare this to the word of Jesus.\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAgain, this is your understanding of Paul. Did Jesus say that the Law\nwas an \"impossible standard?\" Did Jesus say that He superceded the Law?\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nYou acknowledge that it is *your* reading of Paul. What did Jesus say?\nCan you deny that Matt5:14-19 is quite clear in its meaning? Are you \nChristian or Pauline?\n\n\nWhen did Jesus say that the purpose of the Law was conviction of sin?\n\n\nPlease reread Matt5:14-19. Are you Christian or Pauline?\n\n\nAre you saying that the Ten Commandments are ceremonial details?\n\n\nYou call observance of the Sabbath, the day on which the Lord rested,\nceremonial? Has circumcision been superceded for Christians?\n\n....\n\nAre you Christian or Pauline?\n\n[Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is\nnot, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with\nthe question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I\nhave to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.\n\nAs to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies\nof Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't\ncome up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various\nChristian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in\nother newsgroups.\n\nMat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that\nit applies to Gentiles.\n\nAnd yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the\nSabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're\nlooking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.\n\nI'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's\nunfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we\ndo know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus\ndealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt\nwith the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15\nmore than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see\nthat there's a big problem.","target":3},{"content":"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\nfuel to the flame!\n\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\n\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\nand Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard\nbox, and don't walk enough to be useful.\n\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\nat the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.\n\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\nPlus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill\nat $450,000, but that's only what I recall).\n\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5\/6 of the 2+year players\naren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1\/6 that were on the roster\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June\/the\nfirst time Olson\/Berryhill go on the DL.\n\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\nand the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\n\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)\n\nAs for the Schuerholz\/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\nlike this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\n\nCox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\nis better than it used to be.\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\njust won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\n\nCox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.\nOK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\nKlesko?\n\nSchuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\nbut somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\n\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading\ndeadline for my Hunter\/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\nAnd if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There's always the\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\n\nCox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\nin Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\n\nSchuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.\n\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\nrunning into him again?\n\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little\nbit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\n\nCox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\n\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez\ninto the lineup.\n\nCox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used\nto our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\n\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\nwill be hurt by May.\n\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely\none of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I\ncan call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!\nTHE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey\nStengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,\nbut have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally\nget my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!\n\nSchuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those\n\"happy pills\" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you\never hire that guy anyhow?\n\nCox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nEric Roush\t\tfierkelab@\tbchm.biochem.duke.edu\n\"I am a Marxist, of the Groucho sort\"\nGrafitti, Paris, 1968\n\nTANSTAAFL!

Each\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\nper second).\n\n\n\n\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\ndata representations.\n\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\n\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\n\n\n\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

Hiermee ontstond de tweede\nuniversiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste\nwaarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde\nin de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de\nvoorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350\njaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.\n\nDe huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten\nsterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,\nvieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala\naan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een\nplanetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal\nvoordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies\nNatalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\n\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\nBij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\neerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een\nbeknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,\nwaarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een\nhalf uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten\nzullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot\nhet stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op\neen apart vel.\nHet niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars\nstudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN\nZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!\n\nTijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed\ngaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht\nWesterbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen\nhet heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van\neen snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,\nin de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.\nProf. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel\nopvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en\ntrachten te verklaren.\nHet slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de\ntechnische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn\nnamelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10\nmiljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30\nWatt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal\ner niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse\ntechnologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.\n\nDeelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en\nf 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het\nverschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening\n44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de\nABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te\nworden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving\nwordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na\n31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.\n\nHet symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,\nUniversiteit Utrecht.\n\nVoor meer informatie over het symposium kan men terecht bij\nHenrik Spoon, p\/a S.R.O.N., Sorbonnelaan 2, 3584 CA Utrecht.\nTel.: 030-535722.

I don't know if this is\nbelieveing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do\nnot deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions\nfrom evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on\nthe evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere\nis not self explanatory). \n\nChristians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, \nwhich they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence\nis the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The \nevidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning\non the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason\nof the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly\nconsistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the\nevidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself\nto us.\n\nIt is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come\nthrough this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones\nproviding evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be\nphysical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for\nall we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for\nreason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired\nin some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,\nbelief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.\n\nFaith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source \nof evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings\nhave many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and\nsimilarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by\nfaith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use\nreason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding\nof the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be\nthe most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity\nclaims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the\nbest evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.\n\nIf you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while\nand you will see rational debate aplenty.","target":3},{"content":"Yes I am aware CorelDraw exports in SCODAL.\nVersion 2 did it quite well, apart from a\nfew hassles with radial fills.

The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters \nmuch either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.

(818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow\/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright.\"\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.

In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.","target":3},{"content":"\nI agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be \nlearned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems \nto imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth \n(constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be \nnecessary.\n\nIt may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different \nfrom person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is \nright and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple \nminds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly \nthis intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different \nfrom yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute,\nthen at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong.\nI just don't believe that God is that rigid.\n\n\nThis is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles \nare crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take\ntheir word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that \ntheir fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.\n\nI think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter \nof human interpretation and therefore error-prone.

It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.

I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.

That His existence can be proven by reason\nis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \"Traditional Proofs for the \nExistence of God,\" and Summa Theologica).\n\nNow, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,\nI assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen\ncondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?\n\nBecause God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,\nthe Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the\nMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order\nto the universe (logos).\n\nI next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is\ncontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,\nsince God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior\nas early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because\na human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source\nof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.\nThus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.\n\nNow this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim\nis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.\n\nYou next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United\nStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent\ninstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will\nreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,\nand thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For\nexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could\nhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must\nbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. \n\nTherefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.\n\nQED\n \n-- \nboundary","target":3},{"content":"\nJeff Fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for Black Sabbath.\nHe was never ever a musician in the band.

First, in February, the Russians deployed a\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\ndeployed by the inflatable 'frame'.\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\n  \nBut back to Brian's questions:\n  \n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon\nsomeone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\nlaunch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\nand no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\nidiot?)\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time\nof worse seeing due to day\/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding\nfor this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\n  \n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\nmy guest.

It is the fundamental premis \"A is not not-A\". If a thing\nis true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic \nasumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We\nshould distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word \"believe\",\nhowever. The weak sense means I am not sure. \"I believe Tom went to \nthe library.\" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense\nmeans I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. \"I believe \nthat nature operates according to certain fundamental laws.\" (despite \nthe fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian\nbelief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs\nof the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological \ntopics.)\n \n\nNote that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the \nmajority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that\nif Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be\nfalse, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. \n(And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)\n \n\nIt is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless \nthey have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks\nand wants.\n\n\nMost Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living\ntradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly\nby the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.\n\n\nIf depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet\ntall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we \nmay both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive\nthat he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.\n \n\nThus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being \ncan find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find \nabsolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who\ndoes not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.\n\n\nHere I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the\nknowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass \nis half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half\nfull: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole\npoint of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist\nand the optimist express the *same* fact.)\n \nIt is, of course, quite true that different people may express the \nsame belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail\nto understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief\nand may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great\nscisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has\nbeen done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal\nagreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs\nare equally valid.

As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.

It has a density of 0.058 lb\/cu in,\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\nor 75 Statute miles.\n\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\nsection column.  \n\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\n\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40\/lb, and how\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\n\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\nassuming our finished structure costs $100\/lb.  The $40\/lb figure\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower\/payload mass\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\n\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\n15 miles of height.

In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.

I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\n   introduction...\n\nTwo other Intros to consider:\n\nThe \"Introduction\" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text.\nThe references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but\nthe book contains a wealth of information.\n\nPerrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more\nmodern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the\nauthors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order\nof composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the\ndevelopment of the NT.\n\n   ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the\n   best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.\n\nA slight dissent: I think the Harper's is \"OK\" but not great.  One\nparticular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on\nbibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick\nlook-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy\nin my office at work).\n\n   ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...\n\nSo far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title\n(James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think\nI recall a (older) series under the name \"Harper Commentaries\".  Also\nthere's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on\nthe HC also apply to the HBD.)\n\nMy favorite one-volume commentary is the \"New Jerome Biblical\nCommentary\".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased\ntowards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether\nthese are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and\nlarge excellent.\n\nNOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the\n\"Jerome Biblical Commentary\", copies of which can still be found on\nsale.","target":3},{"content":"\nAfter reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies\nstarted the 1964 season at 10-2.

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: \"What does it all mean?\"\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology\/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe\/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we \"graded\" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat's because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to\nsee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.","target":3},{"content":"TO: saz@hook.corp.mot.com\n\n\nSZ>Does anybody know of a program that converts .GIF files to .BMP files\nSZ>and if so, where can I ftp it from?

When I look at\nJesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the\npresense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every\ndetail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But\nas that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His\npresense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it\nwas brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of\nJudas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no\navail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not\nonly then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of\nJesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical\nportion was only the tip of the iceburg.\n\nBTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly\nking.

Kiki Cuyler cut\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw\nto Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.\n     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to\nthird.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\nbeat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\nyear.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\ngap in right-center.  \"Cool Papa\" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off\nand prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \n     \"Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or\nTorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on\nKlein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells\nRose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to\nsustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.\"  So came the\nanalysis from Frank Chance.\n     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder\nmoved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled\nhome a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it\n3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein\nsingled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped\nout of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,\nWilliams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.\nHe fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting\nfor Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into\na 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a\nstrikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\nTrillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The\nCubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.\n     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get\nanother righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock\nplayed third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen\nwas worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against\nLefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\nhome four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added\nanother, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\n     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\nRobin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\nthe Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce\nSutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\neighth.

After winning their first\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1\/2 games out of\nfirst in this wacky season.\n     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2\nSaturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.\nThe Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve\nRogers 3-2.  \"We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\nteam speed,\" remarked Lou Brock.  \"I don't see why we can't win this\ndivision.\"\n     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.

Keith\nHernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  The Pirates have made only\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend\nto be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.\n     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone\nSeaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When\nNolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the\nPirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\n.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert\nBlyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\nruns - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph\nKiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the\ntop of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie\nWilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on\nfirst, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent\nTekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing\nStrawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the\nPirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve\nallowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right\nfield line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\nhomer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): \n    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\npitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\n     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and\nthe Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel\nfaced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\nWillie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don\nBaylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had\none each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\nNational League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.\nThey had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but\nfaltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.\n     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\nfirst game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the\nBraves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\nThe homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell\nBlackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather\ngood.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the\ntrade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\n     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two\nhome runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray\nNarleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel\nPaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after\n10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working\nhis second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and\nJoe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,\nand the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the\nGiants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly\nemotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):\n     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\nwide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in\nthe first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  \"Normally,\" Drysdale remarked, \"I\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't\nDavis will get decked once.\"\n     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is\nthe main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of\nthe nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"It's as if some three-year-old threw a\ntantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit\nhome runs',\" remarked Roy Campanella.\n     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize\nthe Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\nDavis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\naccording to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the\nBaltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with\na two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the\nAstros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened\nto do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.\nWalt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.\n     \"I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,\" he explained.\n     \"How can we do that,\" Pee Wee Reese wondered.\n     \"They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to\nthrow on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\n     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight\ninnings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\nthird.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The\nDodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan\nRyan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando\nValenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\n     \"We're mostly a power team,\" remarked Ron Cey.  \"Jackie and, when he\nplays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\nplays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I\nguess that's why they're so successful there.\"  Indeed, it seems that\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\n     Standings after these weekend series:\nA.L.East\nTeam                     W           L           GB\nNew York                68        42          --\nCleveland               65        46          3.5\nDetroit                 64        46           4\nBoston                  64        47          4.5\nBaltimore               59        52         9.5\nToronto                 43         69        25.5\nWashington              39         73          28\n\nA.L.West\nOaksaselphia            63         48          --\nMinnesota               61         48            1\nChicago                 59         53          4.5\nKansas City             57         54          6.5\nCalifornia              57         56            8\nMilwaukee               45         66           17\nSeattle                 32         78         31.5\n\nN.L.East\nChicago          57         53                --\nPhiladelphia     58         54                --\nSt. Louis        58         54                --\nPittsburgh       56         56                2\nMontreal         53         56               3.5\nNew York         48         64               10\n\nN.L.West\nBrookangeles     66          46               --\nCincinnati       66           47              0.5\nSan Francisco    65          46               0.5\nBoswaukta        54           56               11\nHouston          50          61               17.5\nSan Diego        36          75                29.5","target":1},{"content":"Hi,\n\nCan anybody suggest robust algorithms\/code for computing the point of intersection\non n, 2-d lines in a plane.

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\nin advance)\n\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\n\n[I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\nof the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\ntext.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\nit has much practical effect.\n\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\nthat don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\nall the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition\nthat's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\nI'm afraid.)","target":3},{"content":"\n\nI was at my parents' Seder and noticed the labelling on one of the \npackages was English, Hebrew and French.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\n\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\na very troubling one.\n\nThe problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\n\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\n\n\nLet's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\n\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\nTruth.\n\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\n\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\n\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\n\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\n\n\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\n\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\n\n B: How do you know?\n\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\n\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\n\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\n\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\n\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\n\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\n\n A: ...\n\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\ncan't prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\n\nThere is no way out of the loop.\n\n\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\n\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\n\n *\n\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\nknowably Inerrant.\n","target":3},{"content":"Why use a ground launch pad.

Bede is a great\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\nnot make it more so.\n\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\nFestival.\"\n\nHowever, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\n\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\n\n Yours,\n James Kiefer\n","target":3},{"content":"\nThe sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\nit's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\nof Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.

Some say that if the two have\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\n: qualifier) they are married\/joined in God's sight.\n\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\n\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\n\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\npoint of intercourse.\n\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\nand Joseph went to bed together.\n\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\ndescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\n\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be\ncorrected on that point!)\n\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\n\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?\n\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\n\n-- \n\n-----\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)","target":3},{"content":"\nOr just stick 'em on sci.space.news every 28-30 days? \n\n","target":2},{"content":"I basically agree, the Tigers are my favorite team.

No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would\nnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,\nbut it seems many Christians do not read these groups. \n\nPetri\n","target":3},{"content":"I am looking for an algorithm to determine if a given point is bound by a \npolygon.

Again, if it were to be\ncelebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would\nstill be \"liturgically\" beautiful.

The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\nsimply IS holy.\n\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\nmass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.\n\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\npriest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\nIt doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers].
